0,"31 October, 2023 ","Chandrababu Naidu walks out of Rajahmundry jail, thanks supporters for “prayers and affection”"," The TDP supremo has been ordered to not participate in any other program except his medical check-ups at the hospital.Former Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister Chandrababu Naidu walked out of Rajahmundry jail on Tuesday after Andhra Pradesh High Court granted bail to him in the alleged Skill Development case.After walking out of the central cell, Chandrababu Naidu said, “When I was in trouble, you all came on the roads and prayed for me. I will never forget the affection shown to me, not only in Andhra Pradesh but also in Telangana and across the world.”“In my 45 years of career, I haven’t committed any mistake and will not let anyone do. All the political parties have supported me, all thanks to them,” he added.Chandrababu Naidu was under 53 days of judicial custody. The interim bail has been granted for four weeks. TDP said that the ruling YSRCP has failed in its attempt to label Chandrababu Naidu as a criminal.“Despite all the efforts by the ruling YSRCP to constantly put N Chandrababu Naidu under scrutiny and label him as a criminal, they finally failed today. This shows how the YSRCP is afraid, scared, intimated and terrified of TDP,” the party said.Chandrababu Naidu was granted bail due to health reasons. He has been ordered to surrender on November 24. The court will hear arguments on the main bail petition on November 10. The TDP supremo has been ordered to not participate in any other program except his medical check-ups at the hospital.The TDP supremo has been ordered to not participate in any other program except his medical check-ups at the hospital. The High Court also ordered Naidu to not participate in Media and Political activities.Meanwhile Andhra Pradesh Bharatiya Janata Party chief Daggubati Purandeswari on Tuesday welcomed the state High Court’s decision to grant interim bail to Telugu Desam Party supremo N Chandrababu Naidu in connection with the skill development case. The Andhra Pradesh BJP chief, however, condemned the arrest of Naidu saying that the crackdown on September 9 was not done in an appropriate way.“We welcome the judgement of the (Andhra Pradesh) High Court for granting interim bail to Chandrababu Naidu. We condemn his arrest as it was not done in an appropriate way. They have made a mistake in the past by arresting without giving notice or without conducting an investigation. The method of arrest without adding his name to the FIR is also not the appropriate way. (But) It is a good sign to get interim bail,” Purandeswari said. (This news report is published from a syndicated feed.

1,"31 October, 2023 ","Opposition MPs supposedly get ‘state-sponsored attack’ notification from Apple, govt orders probe: How Apple itself says their notifications are unreliable"," Interestingly, Apple itself on its website states that these so-called ""state-sponsored threats"" to their users' devices are not reliable.In a new political potboiler, some iPhone-using Opposition leaders have claimed to have received “threat alerts” from Apple. “ALERT: State-sponsored attackers may be targeting your iPhone,” the threat notification sent on iMessage and Apple Mail reads.The notification has reportedly been received by Opposition leaders across party lines including Mahua Moitra, Shashi Tharoor, Pawan Khera, KC Venugopal, Priyanka Chaturvedi, Raghav Chadha, Asaduddin Owaisi, and some others.Taking to X, formerly Twitter, Congress MP Shashi Tharoor wrote, “Received from an Apple ID, [email protected], which I have verified. Authenticity confirmed. Glad to keep underemployed officials busy at the expense of taxpayers like me! Nothing more important to do? @PMOIndia @INCIndia @kharge @RahulGandhi.”Received from an Apple ID, [email protected], which I have verified. Authenticity confirmed. Glad to keep underemployed officials busy at the expenses of taxpayers like me! Nothing more important to do?@PMOIndia @INCIndia @kharge @RahulGandhi pic.twitter.com/5zyuoFmaIaInterestingly, Shashi Tharoor had tweeted once before with the screenshot of the email he received, however, in that screenshot, he had forgotten to mask his email ID associated with his Apple ID. Tharoor later deleted the tweeted ad re-posted the screenshot with his email masked. Ironically, it would certainly not take sophisticated state-sponsored hackers to break into the device security of someone, an MP no less, who is not aware of basic protocols that one must follow to keep their devices safe – like not making public vital details attached to your accounts. Similarly dramatic responses were seen coming from Pawan Khera on X, who put the onus of the alleged “threat” on PM Modi saying, “Dear Modi Sarkar, why are you doing this?”Dear Modi Sarkar, why are you doing this? pic.twitter.com/3hWmAx00qlTrinamool Congress MP Mahua Moitra, who recently confessed to giving her Parliamentary login credentials to Darshan Hiranandani who submitted questions against Adani, wrote on X calling Adani and PMO bullies.Received text & email from Apple warning me Govt trying to hack into my phone & email. @HMOIndia – get a life. Adani & PMO bullies – your fear makes me pity you. @priyankac19 – you, I , & 3 other INDIAns have got it so far . pic.twitter.com/2dPgv14xC0“Received text & email from Apple warning me Govt trying to hack into my phone & email. @HMOIndia – get a life. Adani & PMO bullies – your fear makes me pity you. @priyankac19 – you, I, & 3 other INDIAns have got it so far,” Moitra wrote.Notably, the TMC MP has been told to appear before the Lok Sabha Ethics Committee on 2nd November in the cash-for-query case. The case pertains to allegations by BJP MP Nishikant Dubey that Moitra accepted bribes and favours from Darshan Hiranandani including uber-expensive handbags costing up to lakhs of rupees.On 27th October, Moitra accepted that she shared her Parliament login details with the businessman but denied taking any money for it.Meanwhile, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi rushed to conduct a press conference to blame the BJP over the alert. He said, “A number of people in my office have got this message… In Congress, KC Venugopal ji, Supriya, Pawan Khera have got it too…They (BJP) are trying to distract the attention of the youth.”#WATCH | Multiple opposition leaders allege 'hacking' of their Apple devices, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi says, ""A number of people in my office have got this message… In Congress, KC Venugopal ji, Supriya, Pawan Khera have got it too…They (BJP) are trying to distract the… pic.twitter.com/1euRYvAL6oWhile Rahul Gandhi rushed to play politics, it is pertinent to note that some others who certainly can’t be seen as I.N.D.I Alliance members also received the same threat alert message. Samir Saran, who is the President of ORF, a non-partisan, independent think tank also received the threat alert message from Apple. Was notified by Apple late last night that my iPhone linked to my Apple ID is being targeted … I have implemented the on-device remedial measures suggested by Apple and am reaching out to experts as well …. pic.twitter.com/x9KbvcV1ezAdditionally, the same notification has reportedly been received by some Apple iPhone users in Armenia. Screenshots of the same alert were shared by Armenian journalist Artur Papyan @ditord on X. “Apple has issued a new round of threat notifications about State Sponsored attacks. If you’re an Armenia-based journalist or a civil society representative, contact me, @Kornelij or @RubenMuradyan to get your device checked, as well as urgent advice and support,” Papyan posted on X.Apple has issued a new round of threat notifications about State Sponsored attacks. If you're an Armenia-based journalist or a civil society representative, contact me, @Kornelij or @RubenMuradyan to get your device checked, as well as urgent advice and support. pic.twitter.com/kM8DbZKPKPInterestingly, Apple itself on its website states that these so-called “state-sponsored threats” to their users’ device are not reliable.In fact, the very alert that the Opposition leaders claimed to have received states, “While it’s possible this is a false alarm, please take this warning seriously.”Furthermore, Apple has implied that it does not attribute the threat notifications to any specific state-sponsored attacker. “State-sponsored attackers are very well-funded and sophisticated, and their attacks evolve over time. Detecting such attacks relies on threat intelligence signals that are often imperfect and incomplete.”“It’s possible that some Apple threat notifications may be false alarms, or that some attacks are not detected. We are unable to provide information about what causes us to issue threat notifications, as that may help state-sponsored attackers adapt their behaviour to evade detection in the future,” Apple states on the support page on its website.Moreover, it says that Apple is “unable to provide information about what causes us to issue threat notifications”. This means that it is not clear whatsoever whether the alleged attack, that is if it is indeed an attack, is state-sponsored at all. And even if it is “state-sponsored” then there is no telling which state.In fact, after the dramatic press conference of Rahul Gandhi where he directly blamed the Modi government of snooping on “opposition members”, Apple issued a stetement reiterating their position on such threat messages. ""Apple does not attribute the threat notifications to any specific state-sponsored attacker. State-sponsored attackers are very well-funded and sophisticated, and their attacks evolve over time. Detecting such attacks relies on threat intelligence signals that are often imperfect… https://t.co/Bvmi5G1pQ4Apple said, “Apple does not attribute the threat notifications to any specific state-sponsored attacker. State-sponsored attackers are very well-funded and sophisticated, and their attacks evolve over time. Detecting such attacks relies on threat intelligence signals that are often imperfect and incomplete. It’s possible that some Apple threat notifications may be false alarms, or that some attacks are not detected. We are unable to provide information about what causes us to issue threat notifications, as that may help state-sponsored attackers adapt their behavior to evade detection in the future”. According to information available on the tech-giant’s website, “Apple threat notifications are designed to inform and assist users who may have been targeted by state-sponsored attackers.”“These users are individually targeted because of who they are or what they do. Unlike traditional cybercriminals, state-sponsored attackers apply exceptional resources to target a very small number of specific individuals and their devices, which makes these attacks much harder to detect and prevent. State-sponsored attacks are highly complex, cost millions of dollars to develop and often have a short shelf life. The vast majority of users will never be targeted by such attacks,” the company states.Apple has also laid down measures to prevent and combat such threats. “To verify that an Apple threat notification is genuine, sign in to appleid.apple.com. If Apple has sent you a threat notification, it will be clearly visible at the top of the page after you have signed in.”After the fiasco, the Modi government has ordered a probe into the alleged security breach. Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw said, “We are concerned by the statements we have seen in media from some MPs as well as others about a notification received by them from Apple. The notification received by them as per media reports mentions about ‘state-sponsored attacks’ on their devices”. He further said, “Information by Apple on this issue seems vague and non-specific in nature. Apple states these notifications may be based on information which is ‘incomplete or imperfect’. It also states that some Apple threat notifications may be false alarms or some attacks are not detected. Apple has also claimed that Apple IDs are securely encrypted on devices, making it extremely difficult to access or identify them without the user’s explicit permission. This encryption safeguards the user’s Apple ID and ensures that it remains private and protected. The Government of Bharat takes its role of protecting the privacy and security of all citizens very seriously and will investigate to get to the bottom of these notifications. In light of such information and widespread speculation, we have also asked Apple to join the investigation with real, accurate information on the alleged state-sponsored attacks”. On 25th August last year, the Supreme Court said that no conclusive proof emerged to support the claim that the Indian government was using the controversial Pegasus spyware to snoop on people.The then Chief Justice of India NV Ramana said that the apex court-appointed committee probing the matter has concluded that the Israeli spyware was not found in the 29 mobile phones it examined.The controversy erupted on 18th July 2021, when a group of media networks and investigative reporters claimed that among the 50,000 phone numbers chosen for infection with the Pegasus malware were those of Indian ministers, legislators, activists, entrepreneurs, and journalists.Notably, Israel-based company NSO which built the spyware, claims that it only deals with governments and not private entities. However, it never disclosed who its clients were. Several international media outlets, including The Wire from India, released a series of reports claiming the Indian government used the spyware.The reports were based on an “analysis” done by a team of Amnesty International. It is notable that the Supreme Court-appointed committee had also used the tool develop by Amnesty to detect the spyware, along with various other tools.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

Taking to X, he took a dig at Congress stalwart Rahul Gandhi and Kerala CM Pinarayi Vijayan for coming together and ‘jointly’ filing a case against him. He asserted that with such a coercive step, they are trying to threaten him for exposing their appeasement of Hamas. The Minister insinuated that both parties have united for appeasement purposes only, as at the state level both of them have been taking antithetical positions except on a few such issues. He also lambasted both political leaders calling them the biggest appeasers in Indian politics. He emphasised that they had been appeasing “poisonous, radical and violent” organisations like SDPI, PFI, and Hamas who have threatened the security of the Indian state.  Minister Rajeev Chandrashekhar tweeted, “So the two INDI alliance partners Rahul Gandhi and Pinarayi Vijayan have jointly filed a “case” against me.

It started when Chandrasekhar criticised Kerala CM for not acting tough on calls for Jihad by Hamas terrorists and the mindset of killing which resulted in the bomb blasts.  Following the incident, he posted on X, “Dirty shameless appeasement politics by a discredited CM (and HM) Pinarayi Vijayan besieged by corruption charges.

3,"31 October, 2023 ","Cash for queries scam: Mahua Moitra drops defamation lawsuit against media houses and social media platforms, informs Delhi High Court"," The bench of Justice Sachin Datta asked Moitra's counsel Samudra Sarangi to file an amended memo of parties while re-notifying the matter for December 5, 2023.The Trinamool Congress leader Mahua Moitra’s Lawyer on Tuesday informed the Delhi High Court that they are not pressing for any relief in the suit against media houses and social media intermediaries.Noting this, the bench of Justice Sachin Datta asked Moitra’s counsel Samudra Sarangi to file an amended memo of parties while re-notifying the matter for December 5, 2023.Advocate Sidhant Kumar appeared for a media house and submitted that since the plaintiff is not pressing for relief against the media houses, she must amend the suit accordingly as there are some averments against the media houses.Earlier on October 20, 2023, the Delhi High Court adjourned TMC MP Mahua Moitra’s defamation plea against Nishikant Dubey for October 31.On the last date, Nishikant Dubey’s lawyer Abhimanyu Bhandari submitted that a businessman had circulated an affidavit that he had given expensive gifts to the petitioner.Senior Advocate Gopal Sankarnaryan while pushing for an ad interim injunction told the court, “She’s a public figure with standing in the society…unfortunately she was a friend with Dehradari. While Senior Advocate Sankarnaryan appearing for Mahua Moitra, was putting forth his submisisons, Adv Jai Anant Dehradrai, against whom also injunction was sought, objected to him appearing in the case.Dehedrai appeared in person and told the court that Sankaranarayanan contacted him the night before and asked him to withdraw his CBI complaint in exchange for the dog. Following these submissions, Sankarnaryan withdrew from the case.Speaking to the media outside the court complex Gopal Sankarnaryan said “I have absolutely no comments except to say, because Jai (Advocate Jai Anant Dehadrai) instructed me in a case, I had reached out to him yesterday and had asked him is there were any way of exploring a settlement. Jai had said that he would get back to me, but he didn’t. Today when I appeared, Jai personally said to me he had an objection to my appearance. I immediately withdrew and said that I don’t want to do this case.”The Delhi High Court earlier had issued notices to the defendants on Moitra’s suit. Moitra is at the centre of a political storm after BJP MP Nishikant Dubey complained to Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla that she had allegedly taken bribes from a business house to ask questions in Parliament.Earlier Nishikant Dubey in his letter to the Lok Sabha Speaker, titled “Reemergence of nasty ‘Cash for Query’ in Parliament” had alleged “‘serious Breach of Privilege’, ‘Contempt of the House’ and a ‘Criminal Offence’ under Section 120A of IPC” by the Trinamool Congress MP.Dubey claimed that an Advocate, Jai Anant Dehadrai had provided him with proof of a bribe. In her response to this letter, the TMC MP had said that she would welcome a probe by the speaker after he dealt with alleged breach of privilege by other BJP MPs.(This news report is published from a syndicated feed.

He had also asserted that chanting Vande Mataram was against the tenets of Islam.The Samajwadi Party leader was earlier booked for hailing the Taliban and comparing the radical Islamist outfit to Indian freedom fighters.

5,"28 October, 2023 ",Israel-Hamas war: How propaganda pieces in media are used to generate sympathy for Hamas while demonising Israel," As the days pass on, we find the memories of the dead fades, the sudden shock at the sheer audaciousness of the attack and the disbelief at the celebration of death in certain quartersOn 7th of October, 2023, hundreds ot arms-wielding men, landed in Israel, as the people were celebrating Yom Kippur, the Jewish festival of repentance, confessions and forgiveness. The men belonged to Hamas (Harkat-ul-Muqawama al-Islamiya or Islamic Resistance Group), a group designated by many countries as a terror organisation and has officially claimed involvement in several terror acts in the region.The audacious attack left more than 1400 unsuspecting Israeli citizens dead, many wounded and over 200 were carried back to the Hamas-controlled areas of Gaza as hostages. Among the dead, were music lovers who were attending a concert for Peace, infants and kids, as per Israel Government, brutally beheaded and burned down.The world watched in horror as reports of common civilians, those who march around crying Islamophobia across the world, like the famous Latifa AbouChakra of UK (She has been hailed in the past as the face of Muslims persecuted by Europeans in Europe where she lives as a refugee, in the name of Islamophobia), were caught cheering up these inhuman killings fancifully calling these unprecedented and brutal killing Resistance or Intifada hailing it as a moment of triumph.Considering the population of Israel, the US called these killings on proportionate basis, a 9-11, many times over. The details are gory and too many, covered too widely across several media reports.What my objective here is not to repeat the gruesome details and broad silence of Muslims as far as condemning the heinous terror act is concerned. As the days pass on, we find the memories of the dead fades, the sudden shock at the sheer audaciousness of the attack and the disbelief at the celebration of death in certain quarters, not among the uneducated and deprived, rather among the intellectuals and the privileged die down.With this those who stayed mum in the face of very human and instinctive outrage at the 7th of October killings in Israel, tried to find voice with a Hospital attack but it turned out to be a failed rocket attack by Hamas terrorist which caused the misguided missile land in the parking lot of the ill-fated hospital. This clever game of creating fake narrative has been going on for decades and may be centuries but this time, with the prevalence on unorganised media in democratised digital world, the lies were getting caught as quickly as they were floated.Noted journalist Tavleen Singh, a known Modi-critic, wrote attacking Hamas, and was hounded by islamists for that. The hospital attack, which the Hamas-sympathisers tried to use to counter the inhuman killings of 7th October, turned out to be their own doing and took the wind out of the neatly floated Palestine propaganda balloon.However, after initial dilli-dally, Indian National Congress came out with vague statement and then again went into silence. One would have thought that they have run out of their interest in a foreign event, given that elections are around in India. But then as if on cue, Priyanka Vadra tweeted, lamenting on deaths in Gaza, totally ignoring the first event which triggered this revenge violence of a recognised state against a recognised terror organisation.Then I read a piece in today’s (28th October, 2023, Indian Express) by Farah Naqvi, who is mentioned as independent writer and activist, much like Latifa Abouchakra of Britain. In her piece titled Amid Crisis, fear-mongering, she tries to rebut another piece by Yeshaya Rosenman,  a Jewish journalist. Farah Naqvi was incidentally also a member of National Advisory Council of Sonia Gandhi during Congress-led UPA Government, which was an unconstitutional body operating over the elected parliament of India with Sonia Gandhi as quasi-head of the Government of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh.Farah Naqvi, is the daughter of a noted journalist, Saeed Naqvi. In the account of her father’s brush with Covid where he survived, getting oxygen, hospital bed and medical attention with struggle (many did not get and lost their lives too), she finds a place to mention Democracy index and other political points, about how things are wrong with India which eventually saved her father, in spite of pandemic which left a global devastation of hitherto unseen proportions. But then that is how intellectuals in India play. Politics come easy to them and gratitude comes with difficulty.Coming back to the current piece, she writes starting from taking the count of dead Palestinians. On the day when Palestinian death toll crossed 7000. This is based on the report given out by the Health Ministry of Hamas controlled Gaza. These casualty figures mentioned in the Indian Express article by Ms. Naqvi have been disputed by the US authorities. That notwithstanding, the dead in Ms Naqvi articles mention only Palestinians, totally ignoring 1400 dead Israelis. She mocks how in the words of the Jewish journalist, who has actually more stake in the conflict perpetrated by Hamas, War Crimes are moral actions, resistance is aggression and occupied and occupier are same-to-same. This is where it gets clever. She has in one sentence called the response of a sovereign state to the killing of her citizens by a terror-group- war crime, mass-manslaughter by the terror group as Resistance, and called the Jewish who were rehabilitated in their ancient lands by a UN mandate, after the sufferings and genocide in Hitler’s holocaust, as occupier. Now this is a brilliant propaganda piece for master-class in journalism.In his much acclaimed book, On Writing, Sol Stein gives a very interesting example with two news pieces. I quote them here. The first one read- Terence McNiece, 14, was arraigned yesterday in Town Court for allegedly stealing a bicycle belonging to a neighbour.The same piece of news, when written by a smart journalist like Ms Naqvi would read as, again quoting Sol Stein, According to the testimony of her mother, Terrance McNiece wanted a bicycle more than anything in the world, but she couldn’t afford to buy one. Terence, age 14, was arraigned yesterday in Town Court for allegedly stealing a bicycle belonging to a neighbour.Sol writes- Conflict can arise from a thwarted desire, but the desire must be planted here.Does this not explain the occupier-occupied narrative that Ms Naqvi, like all closet Islamist supremacists, are peddling? What can be a bigger, loftier and nobler desire than to be free, the desire to not be occupied. Only slight overlooking of the fact is needed, like Jews lived there centuries before the advent of Islam, that the First Temple was made around ten Centuries before Christ, and almost 15 centuries before the advent of Islam.She has a problem with the Jewish writer trying to superimpose the developments in the Middle-East on India, in terms of Hindus and Muslims of India. But is that not the reason that she has written this rebuttal, she, who technically has no skin in the game, against the person who has something personal at stake here. She has written it as a Muslim and not as an Indian. And I will tell you why- because her history of Al-Aqsa Mosque does not start with Jewish King Soloman but with the fairy tale of Islam, just as her history of Kashi Vishwanath does not start with Kashi being the oldest Hindu city, but it starts with Aurangzeb when after destruction of a very Arabic-Sounding Gyaan Vapi, Muslims went to Courts claiming it is their unalienable right to wash their hands and feet over the structure which Hindus consider their religious idol.The very article which she wrote to pooh-pooh the irrational fears of Yeshahaya, as far as Hindus in India are concerned, substantiates that fear, by the way she reports the terror attack, exposes that hatred that she has. It also underscores the point the Jewish journalist has made, she wants you to be unsuspecting, lulled into a false sense of security, the way Kashmiri Hindus were in the 90s, the Lahori Hindus were in 1946, the way Bengalis of Dhaka were in 1946, till such time that these fears come real.When quoting how the article ends with – If Congress leaders can not find within them a spine, they should remember that they still have a neck.- made her cringe, one wonder if Sar Tan Se Juda slogans coming out on the streets of Bharat made her cringe as much as to write a piece on it, like ever?Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

6,"24 October, 2023 ","Bhagwa Love Trap – a figment of Islamist imagination, created merely to harass Hindu men and counter real cases of Love Jihad, claiming lives of Hindu women"," Where a Hindu boy and a Muslim girl couple are concerned, this is not a matter of masking one's identity; Hindu guys are known by their genuine names to Muslim women, unlike their Muslim counterparts in the cases of “Love jihad”. Therefore, it is evident that BLT was only created as a figment of the Islamist imagination to counter the very real cases of Love Jihad which are claiming the lives of several Hindu women on a regular basis. Love jihad is said to be a figment of the imagination of India’s ‘extreme Hindu religious organisations’. According to Indian media and a large intellectual elite, it is also regarded to be an Islamophobic conspiracy theory concocted by Hindutva ideology followers. They often dismiss it as a political ploy to polarise Hindu voters in support of the now-ruling BJP. Even a sizable portion of Hindus do not believe in the existence of Love Jihad. Despite all the outrage from both parts of society, both are often at odds when it comes to Hindu women eloping with Muslim men in huge numbers.The truth is that many Hindu cinema actors are married to Muslim men in the Indian film business. There is no controversy when renowned actors like Amir Khan, Shahrukh, Saif Ali Khan, and Kabir Khan marry Hindu women. Nawab Pataudi, Azharuddin, and Zahir Khan are all married to well-known Bollywood actresses. Indira Gandhi married Feroz Khan, and BJP leader Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi and Shahnawaz Hussain have Hindu spouses, yet no one has ever questioned it, and no one has ever termed it Love Jihad. Why? Consider following few examples: Case 1. In August 2014, national shooting champion Tara Shahdeo from Ranchi lodged an FIR citing her husband Ranjit Kumar Kohli alias Rakibul Hasan Khan in the national news headlines. Rakibul pretended to be Hindu and introduced his family as a Hindu household. Tara was exposed to his lies when Rakibul asked her to convert to Islam immediately after a marriage sermonised with Hindu tradition in a five-star hotel at Ranchi. Case 2. Sakshi, 16, was slaughtered by her purported lover on May 29 after she refused to continue their connection. Sakshi discovered that the 20-year-old man’s name was Mohammad Sahil, not Sunny. Sahil stabbed the woman numerous times before crushing her skull with a cement boulder in a gruesome murder. Images of Sahil wearing a Kalawa and Rudraksha mala had also emerged.Case 3.  In February 2023, in Haridwar, Uttarakhand’s holy city, Azhar Ahmed pretended to be Rahul in order to marry a Hindu lady, and after nine years of marriage, the victim discovered she was living with a Muslim man. The truth was revealed when she unintentionally discovered an Aadhaar Card at home. It included a picture of her spouse (Rahul), but the name given was Azhar Ahmad. Case 4.  This was December 2022 from Bihar’s Siwan area in which a Muslim guy pretended to be a Punjabi Hindu in order to snare a lady and then abandoned her to seduce another Hindu woman. The accused’s name was Kaleemulla, and he pretended to be Sameer Khanna. He converted the victim, Ratna, to Islam and changed her name to Ayesha Khatun. At the Hussain Ganj police station, a First Information Report (number 324/2022) was filed.Case 5. In July 2022, a case in which a lady, Rachna Solanki, made a police complaint against her husband, Amit Kumar Singh, who was actually Iqrar Qureshi. She discovered the truth nine years after their marriage. Iqrar had two Adhar Cards and his name was put as Amit Kumar on the wedding invitation. On June 18, 2022, the first information report (number 354/2022) was filed at the Jagdishpura police station in the Agra district of Uttar Pradesh. The pair performed Diwali puja and visited many temples together. Rachna claims to be a devout disciple of Lord Hanuman.Case 6. In June 2022, this case is from Madhya Pradesh’s Bhopal area. Here, a woman doctor alleged that the accused, Nehal Khan, disguised as a Hindu in order to ensnare and sexually abuse her and that Nehal lived with her as if she were a Hindu. He accompanied her to temples and observed all rites and holidays. It was impossible for me to believe he was Muslim. Nehal began pressuring Priya to convert to Islam.Let us discuss the common feature in all of these cases: concealing one’s true identity in order to get close to a woman (or very often, a minor). Rakibul hides his identity as being Muslim to marry Tara. To entice the Hindu girl, Iqrar Qureshi disguised himself as Amit Kumar. Sahil Ahmad impersonates Sunny in order to lure Sakshi, marry her, and then murder her when she refuses to convert to Islam. Kallimulla disguised himself as Sameer Khanna to marry Ratna, but when he changed her name to Ayesha Khatun, only she realised it was a ruse. Every day, hundreds of incidents emerge from all around the nation in which Hindu, Christian, Jain, and Sikh females are being deliberately targeted to convert to Islam by this technic. In certain cases, Muslim men who have been captured with Hindu girls by Bajrang Dal activists have admitted to receiving training and money from particular Mosques or Madrassa for suspected Love Jihad, and the incentives are remitted while keeping the girl’s social and financial level in mind.This disguise as Hindu and concealment of Muslim identity in order to entice Hindu girls and women to marry and convert to Islam is known as “Love Jihad” and it is for real. Every day a section of the media is reporting such news of such cases of “Love Jihad.” Concealment of identity is not the only parameter, however. There are several other cases of forced conversion and violence too that have emerged, that fall under the ambit of Love Jihad. The accusation of love Jihad is not about two adults getting along after a courtship, working together, studying together, or even marrying each other where religious considerations are out in the open and anyone who insinuates otherwise is clearly trying to whitewash the criminal phenomenon. Love jihad is often referred to as a hate campaign by Indian intellectual militia. Efforts are being made to establish that it has connections with previous hate campaigns, present white nationalist conspiracy theories, Euro-American Islamophobia etc. It is, however, a well-known fact that Islamists are running this love jihad franchise as their flagship programme as organised and coordinated Jihad against Kafir women – the aims are simple – subjugation and conversion. Let us now discuss the purported “Bhagwa Love Trap” conspiracy theory by Muslim organisations in India. Since the Love Jihad module is in the public domain with the efforts of Hindu organisations such as RSS, VHP, Bajrang Dal etc., Muslim groups have started countering it with a fake narrative. Recently, Muslim scholar Shoeb Jamai accused Hindu organisations of creating Hindu boy’s clubs to seek Muslim females for marriage and conversion. They claimed to have seen a lot of Muslim women hanging out with Hindu men. They showed footage showing Burqa-clad ladies riding pillion on motorbikes with Hindu youths and attacking them, dubbed the “Bhagva Love Trap. According to a covert operation published by Opindia.com, several Islamists, who are part of the “Behen Beti Bachao” group made on social media which the Opindia reporter could sneak into, regularly share Pakistani propaganda content surrounding the “Bhagva Love Trap theory”. These include but are not limited to the inciteful and Hinduphobic videos created by a Pakistani YouTuber Ibne Kazi (screenshots of the WhatsApp chats are attached in the detailed article). The Islamist shared a leaflet, falsely claiming that 10 lakh Muslim women are being converted to Hinduism each year by the RSS as also claimed by Islamic cleric Nomani in his detailed speech. The propaganda-laden material also alleged the conversion and marriage of 800 Muslim women to Hindu men in Amaravati, Maharashtra. Based on reports and social media videos, OpIndia has compiled a total of 50 cases and posted the link on its website, where Hindu men and Muslim women were attacked by extremists under the pretext of the ‘Bhagva love trap.’ The attacks were carried out citing that a sinister plot was underway to convert Muslim women to Hinduism by luring them into a love trap – a conspiracy theory espoused by Sajjad Nomani in his multiple videos.Where a Hindu boy and a Muslim girl couple are concerned, this is not a matter of masking one’s identity; Hindu guys are known by their genuine names to Muslim women, unlike their Muslim counterparts in the cases of “Love jihad”. Therefore, it is evident that BLT was only created as a figment of the Islamist imagination to counter the very real cases of Love Jihad which are claiming the lives of several Hindu women on a regular basis.

7,"23 October, 2023 ",The Hindu continues to peddle the North-South divide based on lies peddled by Communist Party leader and JNU prof: 15th Finance Commission report and the truth," The Wire started this lie. The Business Standard picked it up. Not to be left behind, Shekhar Gupta called North India as a tax burden on South India. The Hindu has been running it ever since. Divisive politicians have been using these lies to propagate their own agenda. How many more times will The Hindu continue to publish the same lies? Just about 15 days back, The Hindu published an article on an imaginary North-South divide and we had given a detailed rebuttal to it. In the conclusion of that article, we had written that “It is tiresome to listen to their repeated lies but then it is also important to repeatedly counter their lies too.”Looks like someone at The Hindu took this conclusion seriously and wanted to test if we would really repeatedly counter their repeated lies! And so, on the exact same topic, they publish yet another tripe on October 20th.  This time, they interview two known suspects – one is a former Finance minister from the Communist party (Thomas Issac) and another is a former professor from JNU (Balveer Arora). Thomas Issafc, who sadly was a Finance Minister once, opens his argument with an outright lie – that there are only two criteria defined by the Finance Commission on how to devolve funds to the States. We have repeatedly busted this lie but there just seems to be no end to the freedom that The Hindu and their ilk provide to these serial liars. The 15th Finance Commission has the following 6 criteria on which it decides how best to devolve the funds to the states in India. Income Distance and Population from the 2011 census are just 2 of those criteria. States that have done well on Forest and Ecology, Demographic performance and Tax Effort actually get rewarded better by the 15th Finance Commission – which is basically the key demand of these folks! It is intriguing to see this ilk assume that the people of this country will not have access to such basic information, and therefore they can simply publish lies and get away with it. The opening argument of the other interviewee, Balveer Aurora, is even more hilarious. In his infinite wisdom, he says – “if the population basis is being shifted from 1971 to a new figure, the weightage of the population can be adjusted. It is not written in stone that it has to remain the same”. Guess what – the weightage to the population in the 13th FC report was 25%. That report used the 1971 census as a reference (Yes, even for the period 2010 to 2015, we used the 1971 census as a reference!). The weightage to the population in the 15th FC report was 15%. That report used the 2011 census as a reference (Finally, the much-needed correction was made). So, when the population basis was shifted from 1971 to 2011, the weightage given only to the population had already been adjusted from 25% to 15%. How does the former Professor from a reputed university like JNU miss such basic information before making such banal arguments? After years of providing a platform for such hate mongers, The Hindu decides for the first time that they will ask a factual question on this subject – and hence pose the question to Thomas Issac:Thomas Issac goes on a verbal tirade that doesn’t answer the question. He continues to claim that “Kerala, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu” are at a loss. This argument that states are at a “loss” has been made by politicians from other states too. KCR’s son, KTR, for example, claims that while Telangana paid 3.68 lakh crores to the central government, it only got back 1.68 lakh crores in return. He went to the extent of calling everyone who countered this fallacious argument “ignoramuses”. This set me thinking. In this particular example, the INR 3.68 lakh crores is the amount that people of India, specifically residing in Telangana, have paid as Tax directly to the Government of India. From this amount, a total of 1.78 lakh crore rupees have been transferred to the Government of Telangana, by the Government of India. KTR makes it sound like 3.68 lakh crores is the tax paid by the government of Telangana to the government of India. Thomas Issac also sounds similar in his arguments.Let’s for a moment just buy this argument. If Telangana paid 3.68 lakh crores to the Government of India, how come only 1.78 lakh crores have come back to the government? Because this amount does not include the 1.08 lakh crore spent directly by GoI on roads in Telangana alone. It does not include the 1.58 lakh crore spent directly by GoI on procuring Paddy and Cotton from Telangana alone. It does not include the nearly 1 lakh crore spent on Infrastructure such as railways, power, energy, irrigation etc for Telangana alone. It does not include thousands of crores spent on welfare scheme beneficiaries in Telangana alone. A rough calculation pegs this amount to about 8.3 lakh crores! Am sure such similar numbers exist for Kerala too. The reason so many numbers for Telangana are known is that Union Minister G. Kishan Reddy released a detailed 320 slide presentation with all these numbers to counter the baseless arguments of KCR and his family. The moot point is that these divisive politicians and media are framing the debate in terms of a balance sheet of money alone. And in the garb of making an argument, they are simply falling back on the same lies again and again. The Hindu has been at the forefront of spreading these lies. Pompous editorials and Op-Eds questioning even the “constitutional propriety” of the 15th FC began back in 2018. In fact, this particular article even made the argument that the terms of reference for the 15th Finance Commission could have been silent on which population census to use. The Wire started this lie. The Business Standard picked it up. Not to be left behind, Shekhar Gupta called North India a tax burden on South India. The Hindu has been running it ever since. Divisive politicians have been using these lies to propagate their own agenda. How many more times will The Hindu continue to publish the same lies? Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

8,"20 October, 2023 ","Amid the India-Canada standoff, India has, under the leadership of PM Modi, made it clear that we are no more a pushover nation"," Besides India's stern approach towards Canada, it's neutral stance over the Russia-Ukraine war and India's strong retaliation to China's Galwan misadventure, that has strongly signalled to the world that the days of India caving in to pressure from world powers are long gone by. On Friday, October 20, Canada withdrew 41 diplomats and their families from India. The move came after India gave an ultimatum for revoking the diplomatic immunity of those diplomats who stayed back post-10th of October even after being told to leave.Diplomatic ties between India and Canada nose-dived after Canada prematurely expelled an Indian diplomat on the 19th of September following baseless allegations by Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of the involvement of Indian agents in the murder of Khalistani terrorist Hardeep Singh Nijjar. India went on to promptly expel a Canadian diplomat in a tit-for-tat response to Ottawa’s expulsion of an Indian official over the case. New Delhi also suspended visa services for Canadian nationals.The chill in relations between the two countries was even evident at the G20 Leaders’ Summit in New Delhi on September 9 and 10, so much so that even local Canadian media chastised its Prime Minister for being overlooked by Indian and other foreign leaders during the G20 Summit.As the bilateral relations between Canada and India worsen, several reports suggest that Canada has been desperately trying to diffuse the diplomatic row with India. India, on its part, has made it clear that it is no longer a pushover nation and would not tolerate acts of aggression, hate, and intimidation from the rest of the world. The Western big powers like the US, Russia and the UK have also when it came to the India-Canada standoff, chosen to steer clear of strongly-worded public statements that would antagonise India, fearing diplomatic backlash from one of the fastest-growing countries in the world and regarded as a potential counterweight to an increasingly assertive China. This is why, when the Canadian Prime Minister sought the support of many countries, including the United States, the United Kingdom and Australia, to raise the issue with India he was snubbed by everyone fearing diplomatic backlash from India.The USA, which has a habit of interfering in every nation’s domestic affairs, was also compelled to toe a fine diplomatic line when it came to the India-Canada standoff. While avoiding offending Canada, one of its closest allies, it did not dare to oppose India. This is primarily because, India, in recent years, has advanced to a position where it is seen as a crucial defence partner for the United States and an essential counterweight to China.The West, including Canada, also has other major things to consider when it comes to India, including strong defence and trade ties that both sides would rather see maintained and strengthened.Another major reason why the Western nations haven’t taken sides may be that they are aware that India’s demand for parity in mutual diplomatic presence does not violate any international rules. In fact, when Canada accused India of flouting the Vienna Convention in withdrawing diplomatic immunity from 41 Canadian diplomats, India strongly responded to Canada’s statement on the withdrawal of some of its diplomats following India’s prod and said no international norm was violated seeking parity in the mutual diplomatic presence in New Delhi and Ottawa. Basically, the Canadian presence in India is much more than India’s presence in Canada. Therefore, India has asked Canada to take back the excess diplomats so that it is equal to Indian diplomats in Canada.Moreover, the West is also completely aware that India is well aware that it has the upper hand and that, if it chooses, it can turn the faucet off and hurt Canada where it hurts the most.The majority of overseas students studying in Canada are from India. According to statistics provided by the Canadian government, around 40% of the 8 lakh international students studying in Canada at the moment are from India. Indian students pay three to five times more in tuition than Canadians do at private colleges. In a sense, Indians support the entire Canadian private college ecosystem, which will disintegrate if the Indian government decides to stop the outflow. Moreover, as many as 600 Canadian companies, including Bombardier and SNC Lavalin, have a strong presence in India, while more than 30 Indian companies, such as infotech majors TCS, Infosys and Wipro have invested billions of dollars in Canada, creating thousands of jobs.The above multiple reasons might have also compelled Canada to change its rhetorics. On Tuesday, October 17, Trudeau and Foreign Minister Melanie Joly indicated that they did not want to fuel tensions with India by speaking about them publicly — a sharp contrast with the open claims against India that the prime minister made in parliament.It is, however, not just in reference to how India has been handling the India-Canada standoff but there are other recent bold decisions India has taken under the leadership of PM Modi like maintaining a neutral stance over the Russia-Ukraine war and India’s strong retaliation to China’s Galwan misadventure, that has strongly signalled to the world that India has a mind of its own and that the days of India caving in to pressure from world powers are long gone by.When Modi initially took office as Prime Minister in May 2014, nobody anticipated this three-time Chief Minister of Gujarat and outsider to Lutyens’ Delhi would become the nation’s top diplomat and steer foreign affairs like a gifted artist. But like in other areas, PM Modi took the initiative and crafted a new multi-dimensional foreign policy of multiple allegiances and issue-based allegiances, which has elevated India to the position of most sought-after partner on the international stage. After all, who could hug two arch-rivals- US President Joe Biden and Russian President Vladimir Putin with the same panache?It is difficult to think of another world leader who could tell Putin directly that this is “not the age of war,” and also persuade his foreign minister S Jaishankar to tell the arrogant West that “Europe’s problems are not the world’s problems,” while yet managing to maintain good relations with both sides.The West actually fought tooth and nail to have us on their side during the Russia-Ukraine war. India was under intense pressure from the United States to adopt a position. Despite the pressure, India resisted giving in. India remained impartial in regard to the situation between Russia and Ukraine despite pressure from the West.India’s toughness in its attitude was warmly received by the West, which was demonstrated by the fact that despite their differences, the U.S. and India have continued to have a strong collaboration in areas such as business, technology, security, and education.In June 2020, Indian and Chinese troops clashed in the Galwan Valley. The clash was the worst fighting in over four decades and resulted in severe casualties on both sides. The deaths of 20 Indian soldiers was the first time Indian Army personnel were killed on the Line of Actual Control since October 1975.China, still celebrating its victory in 1962, blatantly misjudged India’s resolve to oppose its land-grabbing strategies this time. Beijing was shocked when the Modi administration chose to protect India’s frontiers.At first, India and China had multiple rounds of discussions, both officially in Delhi and Beijing and at the level of military commanders on the LAC. However, when it became clear that China would not back down, India made the decision to establish trade limitations on Chinese investors and goods.The Indian government, led by Prime Minister Modi, authorized the Indian Army to respond to any further escalation on the front lines in a responsible manner. An example of this was the aggressive occupation of specific heights by Indian troops near the Pangong Tso on August 5, 2020, which caught China off guard.With its handling of China’s Galwan misadventure, India once again demonstrated to the world that it is no longer a nation to be taken lightly.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

9,"19 October, 2023 ",Theory of ‘Basic Structure’ and its impact on NJAC: Why a synthesized NJAC would be better than the Collegium system," The National Judicial Appointments Commission (NJAC) Act was passed in 2014 with the aim of introducing a new mechanism for appointments. However, in 2015, the Supreme Court struck down the NJAC Act, asserting that it violated the basic structure of the Constitution and upheld the primacy of the collegium system.The Constitution remains a living document that reflects the will of the people as expressed through its founding principles and values. The Constitution of India is made up of several key components that include the Preamble, Part III & Part IV of the Constitution of India. Additionally, it includes fundamental principles like democracy, secularism, socialism, and sovereignty, which guide the functioning of the Indian state. The Constitution establishes a federal parliamentary structure backed by three concrete independent yet assimilated and synergized pillars of powers separated out as the executive, legislative, and judicial branches.DISTRIBUTION OF CONSTITUTIONAL & LEGAL POWERSThe Constitution ensures the separation of powers by defining the roles, functions, and limitations of each branch. Additionally, it includes mechanisms to prevent one branch from unduly encroaching upon the powers of another. The specific allocation of powers in the Indian Constitution is a crucial feature that evolved to concretize a balance of power amongst all three domains and simultaneously ensure that one power constituent does not infringe upon the other’s sphere. The separation of powers is a fundamental feature of our Constitution that ensures the allocation of roles, responsibilities and powers to three distinct branches with inbuilt checks and balances.EXECUTIVE BRANCHThe executive branch consists of two separate sub-branches; one is administrative & the other is political executive. The administrative branch is committed to implementing and enforcing rules and regulations and protects the sanctity of the law of the land. The Political executive is represented by the President of India, the Vice President, and the Council of Ministers (headed by the Prime Minister). The executive branch is expected to run the day-to-day affairs of the government, making policy decisions, and implementing laws passed by the Legislature.LEGISLATIVE BRANCHThe legislative branch is primarily responsible for formulating laws. The legislative power is demonstrated by two houses – the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha. The Parliament of India has the power to make, amend, and repeal laws on various subjects listed in the Constitution.JUDICIAL BRANCHThe judiciary is owed with responsibility to dispense justice & also interpret the laws. It is independent of the other two branches.ARTICLE 13Article 13 primarily focuses on safeguarding fundamental rights. It states that any law whether pre- or post-Constitution which is found in conflict with or at variance with fundamental rights shall be revoked to the extent of variance. It empowers the judiciary to review laws and, if necessary, strike them down if they violate fundamental rights. Article 13 provides a protective umbrella to maintain the inviolability of fundamental rights due to any legislative or executive action. The term “law” in Article 13 includes not only statutes and legislation passed by Parliament or State Legislatures but also ordinances, regulations, orders, bylaws, rules, and other forms of delegated or subordinate legislation. Article 13(2) empowers the judiciary, especially the Supreme Court and High Courts to review the constitutionality of laws where if any law is assessed to be in violation of fundamental rights and inherent spirits, the same can be suitably declared void to the extent of inconsistency. The Court held that an amendment under Article 368 is “law” within the meaning of Article 13 of the Constitution and therefore, if an amendment “takes away or abridges” a Fundamental Right conferred by Part III, it is void. In essence, Article 13 serves as a safeguard for the fundamental rights of Indian citizens and ensures that any existing law or new legislation that violates these rights can be declared void by the judiciary, upholding the supremacy of the Constitution. Article 13 is a critical tool in ensuring that fundamental rights are not violated or undermined by any legislative or executive action. It provides a mechanism for citizens to challenge laws that infringe upon their fundamental rights in the courts.ARTICLE 368Article 368 of the Constitution of India deals with the power of Parliament to amend the Constitution. It outlines the procedures and mechanisms for amending various parts of the Indian Constitution. It grants Parliament the power to amend various provisions of the Constitution. Article 368 confers upon the Parliament of India the power to amend the Constitution. It can amend any provision of the Constitution including the provisions related to the fundamental rights of citizens. Amendments can be made by introducing a bill in either house of Parliament (Lok Sabha or Rajya Sabha). Some amendments can be passed by a simple majority of the members present and voting in each house. Certain other amendments, which are not related to the federal structure but still affect significant parts of the Constitution, require a special majority. This means they must be passed by most of the total membership of each house and by a two-thirds majority of the members present and voting. Article 368 itself contains an exception. It specifies that certain provisions of the Constitution, such as the federal structure, Parliamentary form of government etc. cannot be amended without the ratification of most state legislatures. Article 368 is crucial in understanding the process by which the Indian Constitution can be amended. The theory of Basic Structure impinges upon the ambit of amendment to any provisions of the Constitution of India.THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN ARTICLE 13 AND ARTICLE 368 CAN BE UNDERSTOOD AS FOLLOWSArticle 13 acts as a watchdog on the power of Parliament as provided under Article 368. It ensures that while Parliament has the authority to amend the Constitution, it cannot do so in a manner that violates fundamental rights. Article 13 does not make all constitutional amendments invalid. Instead, it applies specifically to amendments that violate fundamental rights. If a constitutional amendment infringes upon fundamental rights, it can be declared void to that extent, as per Article 13. The doctrine of Basic structure limits the amending power of Parliament, is a product of judicial interpretation and was established in the Keshvanand Bharati case (1973). It harmonizes the powers of Article 13 and Article 368 by allowing amendments that do not affect the basic structure of the Constitution and ensuring that fundamental rights are protected. While Article 13 and Article 368 have different purposes, they work together to maintain a balance between amending the Constitution and protecting fundamental rights. The basic structure doctrine which is a judicially evolved concept in the epoch-making Keshwa NandThe Bharti case is a key element that reconciles by setting limits on the amendment power to prevent any alteration of the core principles of the Constitution. The Basic Structure is however not defined & is left to the interpretation of Justices of the bench, every time it gets constituted.OVERSTEPPING OF ORGANSLegislature Overstepping:The legislature may sometimes pass laws that are in violation of the Constitution. In such cases, the judiciary has the authority to strike down these laws through judicial review.Executive  Overstepping:The executive can issue ordinances in exceptional circumstances when Parliament is not in session. However, if the legislature excessively uses ordinances to bypass the normal legislative process, it can be seen as overstepping its authority. The President, on the advice of the Cabinet, can declare a state of emergency under specific circumstances. However, if the executive misuses emergency powers for political gain or to suppress dissent, it can be seen as overstepping its authority.Judiciary  Overstepping:While the judiciary’s role includes interpreting the Constitution and protecting fundamental rights, excessive judicial activism, where the judiciary takes on roles that are traditionally the domain of the executive or legislature, can be seen as overstepping. It’s important to note that the allocation of powers in the Indian Constitution is designed to create a delicate balance and each branch has specific checks and balances on the others to prevent overstepping. Additionally, the concept of judicial review allows the judiciary to strike down laws and actions that violate the Constitution, serving as a vital safeguard against overreach by the legislature and executive. In practice, maintaining this balance is an ongoing challenge, and instances of overstepping can arise. However, the system relies on the vigilance of each branch, as well as public awareness and engagement, to ensure that the principles of democracy and the rule of law are upheld. In any democratic system, including India, there is always the potential for one branch of government to overstep its authority, which can lead to a disruption of the system of checks and balances. Here are some common examples of overstepping of authority by the three branches of government in India: where the judiciary is perceived to have overstepped its boundaries into the legislative and executive domains in India, has been a subject of debate. While the judiciary’s role includes interpreting the Constitution and ensuring the protection of fundamental rights, there have been instances where it has made decisions that some critics argue encroach upon the functions of the other branches of government. The term “judicial activism” is often used to describe instances where the judiciary takes an active role in shaping public policy and governance. Critics argue that at times, judicial activism has led to the judiciary overstepping its role. For instance, in the case of Vishakha v. State of Rajasthan, the Supreme Court formulated guidelines on workplace sexual harassment even before specific legislation was enacted. While this was seen as a necessary step to protect women’s rights, it raised questions about whether the judiciary was intruding into legislative territory. The judiciary has been actively involved in environmental matters, issuing directives and guidelines to address issues like air pollution, river cleaning, and industrial pollution. While this has been necessary to protect the environment and public health, critics argue that such interventions sometimes bypass the executive’s role in crafting and implementing environmental policies. made by the executive. The judiciary has been involved in decisions related to religious practices. The Sabarimala temple entry case, where the Supreme Court allowed women of all ages to enter the temple, raised questions about whether the judiciary was infringing on religious traditions and practices, a domain traditionally left to religious authorities. The judiciary has been involved in issues related to reservation policies. In some cases, it has ordered changes in reservation criteria or questioned the implementation of reservation policies, which are primarily within the legislative domain. It’s essential to recognize that these instances of perceived judicial overreach often come with differing interpretations and perspectives. Some view them as necessary interventions to protect fundamental rights and uphold the rule of law, while others argue that they encroach on the legislative and executive functions. To address concerns about judicial overreach, there have been calls for greater clarity in the separation of powers, the need for well-defined roles and responsibilities of each branch of government, and discussions on judicial reform to ensure that the judiciary respects the boundaries set by the Constitution while upholding the rights and welfare of citizens. While the judiciary’s role includes interpreting the Constitution and protecting fundamental rights, and excessive judicial activism, the judiciary takes on roles that are traditionally the domain of the executive or legislature, which can be seen as overstepping.While judicial review is a crucial aspect of the separation of powers, an overly broad interpretation of this power can lead to a perception that the judiciary is encroaching on the legislative and executive domains. It’s important to note that the separation of powers in the Indian Constitution is designed to create a delicate balance and each branch has specific checks and balances on the others to prevent overstepping. Additionally, the concept of judicial review allows the judiciary to strike down laws and actions that violate the Constitution, serving as a vital safeguard against overreach by the legislature and executive. In practice, maintaining this balance is an ongoing challenge, and instances of overstepping can arise. However, the system relies on the vigilance of each branch, as well as public awareness and engagement, to ensure that the principles of democracy and the rule of law are upheld.KESHVANAND BHARTI CASEIn the Keshvanand Bharati case, relief was sought against the Kerala government vis-à-vis two state land reform laws, which imposed restrictions on the management of religious property. Question underlying the case: Was the power of Parliament to amend the Constitution unlimited? In other words, could Parliament alter, amend, or abrogate any part of the Constitution even to the extent of taking away all fundamental rights? The Constitutional Bench in the Keshvanand Bharati case ruled by a 7-6 verdict that Parliament could amend any part of the Constitution so long as it did not alter or amend the basic structure or essential features of the Constitution. However, the court did not define the term ‘basic structure’, and only listed a few principles — federalism, secularism, democracy — as being its part. The ‘basic  structure doctrine has since been interpreted to include:BASIC STRUCTUREThe basic structure doctrine was established in Keshvanand Bharati v. State of Kerala in 1973. In this case, the Supreme Court ruled that Parliament has the power to amend the Constitution, however, cannot do so in a manner that violates or alters its basic structure. This doctrine is significant because it places limitations on the amending power of the Indian Parliament, ensuring that the core principles and values of the Constitution remain intact and unaltered. It was developed to determine the limits of the amending power of Parliament (under Article 368) and to protect certain core principles and values of the Constitution. The power of judicial review, which empowers the judiciary to measure the constitutionality of laws and actions including constitutional amendments, is a vital part of the doctrine of Basic Structure. The primary aim of the basic structure doctrine is to ensure that the fundamental principles and essential features of the Constitution, which are vital for maintaining democracy, justice, equality, and the rule of law, are not arbitrarily or substantially altered through constitutional amendments. The basic structure doctrine is a legal principle developed by the Indian judiciary, particularly by the Supreme Court of India.CHANGE INEVITABLEThe architects of the Indian Constitution granted confirmed powers to Parliament as per the needs and demands of “We the People”. Article 368, which gives Parliament the power to amend the Constitution, can also be amended. The Constitution is an ever-developing index & a reflection of the collective consciousness of the citizens which embodies the spirit of the nation. The dynamism in the Constitution is integral, however, the Doctrine of Basic Structure impedes the dynamism. The impact of the past enriches it now and makes the future richer than the present.” A provision for amending the Constitution has been made to address any challenges “We the People” may face in the future as the Constitution functions since time is not static; it is always changing, just as the political, economic, and social circumstances of the people do.APPOINTMENT OF JUSTICES PRIOR TO 1993Before the introduction of the collegium system in 1993, the appointment of judges to the higher Courts in India, including the Supreme Court and High Courts, was primarily made under the provisions of Article 124 and Article 217 of the Indian Constitution. The Chief Justice of India, as the head of the judiciary, would recommend the names of candidates for appointment as judges to the President. These recommendations were often made after consultation with other senior judges, both within the Supreme Court and the concerned High Court. The President of India, bound by the advice of the Council of Ministers (the executive branch), would make the final appointments based on the recommendations received from the Chief Justice and the Executive. The executive branch played a significant role in the appointment process. The President would consider the recommendations and could seek further information or clarification if necessary. In practice, the government had a significant say in the appointment process. While the Chief Justice’s recommendations were considered, the government’s role in the final decision often led to allegations of political influence in judicial appointments. The introduction of the collegium system in 1993 marked a significant shift in the appointment process. Under the collegium system, a group of senior judges of the Supreme Court, including the Chief Justice of India, became responsible for recommending candidates for judicial appointments. This system was cited as aimed at enhancing the independence of the judiciary in the appointment process. It means that all appointments of justices up to 1993 were incorrect and subject to legislative and executive interference. It is assumed that the frailties of the appointment of justice were over with the introduction of a collegium system with necessary transparency and accountability. The question of whether all judicial appointments made before the introduction of the collegium system in 1993 were “incorrect” or subject to legislative and executive interference is a matter of perspective and legal interpretation. The introduction of the collegium system was aimed at addressing certain perceived shortcomings in the earlier appointment process and enhancing the independence of the judiciary, but it does not inherently render all prior appointments “incorrect.”ADVENT OF COLLEGIUMThe collegium system was introduced through a series of judicial pronouncements and not through a specific legislative enactment. It evolved gradually over several decades. The term “collegium” itself was coined in the 1990s. The idea of judicial consultation in the appointment of judges can be traced back to various judicial precedents. For example, in the 1977 case of S.P. Gupta v. Union of India, commonly known as the “First Judges Case,” the Supreme Court held that the Chief Justice of India (CJI) should consult with a plurality of judges to make recommendations for appointments of Justices. The significant development in the establishment of the collegium system came in the Second Judges Case, also known as the Advocates-on-Record Association v. Union of India (1993). In this case, the Supreme Court held that the CJI should make recommendations to the President in consultation with a collegium of senior judges. The court ruled that the executive’s role should be limited to appointing judges based on these recommendations. Following the Second Judges Case, the collegium system became the standard practice for judicial appointments in India. The system evolved over time, and the composition of the collegium varied, but it generally included the CJI and a group of senior judges of the Supreme Court. Several other cases and judgments in subsequent years further clarified and reaffirmed the collegium system’s role in the appointments and transfers of judges.NJACNational Judicial Appointments Commission (NJAC): The issue of judicial appointments faced significant debate and controversy, leading to attempts to change the appointment process. The National Judicial Appointments Commission (NJAC) Act was passed in 2014 with the aim of introducing a new mechanism for appointments. However, in 2015, the Supreme Court struck down the NJAC Act, asserting that it violated the basic structure of the Constitution and upheld the primacy of the collegium system. NJAC was an attempt to reform the judiciary’s appointment process and may not be seen as legislative overreach per se, the judiciary’s concerns about the potential impact on judicial independence were central to the court’s decision. This complex issue reflects the ongoing debate about the balance between the branches of government and the role of the judiciary in safeguarding the Constitution in India’s democratic system.EXISTING ARRANGEMENTIt is true that the appointment process before the judiciary evolved into the collegium system, allowing involvement and influence from the executive branch, particularly in the final decision-making stage. This sometimes led to allegations of political interference in judicial appointments. While the introduction of the collegium system was a significant step toward enhancing judicial independence in the appointment process, it does not necessarily render all appointments made before 1993 as “incorrect.” The issue of judicial appointments is complex and has evolved over time in response to various challenges and concerns. The collegium system is one of the many mechanisms designed to address these concerns, but it is not without its own set of criticisms and debates. While the judiciary plays a vital role in safeguarding the Constitution, it also has its limitations. It cannot directly enforce its decisions, relying on the executive branch to implement them. Leaving the judiciary as the sole custodian may raise questions about democratic accountability. Judges are not elected representatives, and some argue that their power should be checked by elected officials who are directly accountable to the people. The theory of separation of powers suggests that no single branch of government should have unchecked authority. While the judiciary’s independence is crucial, an appropriate balance of powers among the branches is essential for a well-functioning democracy. The power to amend the Constitution (under Article368) lies with the legislature. If the judiciary was the sole custodian, it could potentially limit the ability of the legislature to make necessary constitutional amendments. In practice, the Indian Constitution is committed to establishing a system of balance among the three branches of government: the executive, the legislature, and the judiciary. While the judiciary plays a significant role in interpreting and upholding the Constitution, it does so within the broader framework of democratic governance.Ambedkar said, “However good the Constitution is, it might turn out not to be good if the people were administering it bad however bad the Constitution is, it might do its job well if people administering it happen to be good.” “Enlightened statesmen will not always be at the helm” and “if men were angels, no government would be necessary”, we get to an axiomatic idea of checks and balances.The question of whether the judiciary alone the custodian of the Constitution of India should be is a matter of considerable debate and has been a subject of discussion in legal and political circles.JUDICIARY AS CUSTODIAN OF THE CONSTITUTIONThe judiciary is designed to be an independent branch of government, which is essential for interpreting and upholding the Constitution impartially. Its decisions are not influenced by political considerations.Judges have legal expertise and training, which makes them well-suited to interpreting and applying the Constitution’s provisions and principles accurately.The judiciary serves as a check on the actions of the executive and legislative branches to ensure that they are in conformity with the Constitution. This helps prevent potential abuse of power.The power of judicial review allows the judiciary to strike down laws and actions that violate the Constitution. This is a critical mechanism for protecting individual rights and preserving constitutional values.COUNTERVIEW OF JUDICIARY AS SINGLE CUSTODIAN OF THE CONSTITUTIONWhile the judiciary plays a vital role in safeguarding the Constitution, it also has its limitations. It cannot directly enforce its decisions, relying on the executive branch to implement them.Leaving the judiciary as the sole custodian may raise questions about democratic accountability. Judges are not elected representatives, and some argue that their power should be checked by elected officials who are directly accountable to the people.The separation of powers doctrine suggests that no single branch of government should have unchecked authority. While the judiciary’s independence is crucial, an appropriate balance of powers among the branches is essential for a well-functioning democracy.The power to amend the Constitution (under Article 368) lies with the legislature. If the judiciary were the sole custodian, it could potentially limit the ability of the legislature to make necessary constitutional amendments.The consensus in most democratic systems is that the Constitution should be a shared responsibility, with each branch of government playing a role in its protection and preservation. The exact balance between these branches can vary from one country to another, depending on the specific constitutional framework and historical context.HERE IS HOW THE APPOINTMENT PROCESS WORKED PRIOR TO THE COLLEGIUM SYSTEMBefore the introduction of the collegium system in 1993, the appointment of judges to the higher courts in India, including the Supreme Court and High Courts, was primarily made by the President of India in consultation with the Chief Justice of India. This method was based on Article 124 and Article 217 of the Indian Constitution. The CJI, SC as the head of the judiciary,would recommend the names of candidates for appointment as judges to the President. These recommendations were often made after consultation with other senior justices, both within the Supreme Court and the concerned High Court. President’s Decision: The President of India, acting on the advice of the Council of Ministers (the executive branch), would make the final appointments based on the recommendations received from the Chief Justice and the Executive.The executive branch played a significant role in the appointment process. The President would consider the recommendations and could seek further information or clarification if necessary.In practice, the government had a significant say in the appointment process. While the Chief Justice’s recommendations were taken into account, the government’s role in the final decision often led to allegations of political influence in judicial appointments.The introduction of the collegium system in 1993 affected the process of appointment of judges significantly, tilting the weight towards the judiciary. Under the collegium system, a group of senior judges of the Supreme Court, including the Chief Justice of India, became responsible for recommending candidates for judicial appointments. The system was said to be committed to ushering in the independence of the judiciary. It’s important to note that the collegium system itself has faced criticism and debate, with some arguing that it lacks transparency and accountability. The issue of judicial appointments in India has been the subject of ongoing reform discussions, and various proposals for change have been considered over the years.The question of whether all judicial appointments made before the introduction of the collegium system in 1993 were “incorrect” or subject to legislative and executive interference is a matter of perspective and legal interpretation. The introduction of the collegium system was aimed at addressing certain perceived shortcomings in the earlier appointment process and enhancing the independence of the judiciary, but it does not inherently render all prior appointments “incorrect.”It is true that the appointment process before the collegium system allowed for involvement and influence from the executive branch, particularly in the final decision-making stage. This sometimes led to allegations of political interference in judicial appointments.The introduction of the collegium system was one of several reforms aimed at improving the appointment process and reducing the potential for political interference. However, no system is without its own criticisms and challenges.Appointing judges to the higher courts is a complex and nuanced process. It involves considerations of legal expertise, integrity, experience, and the need to uphold the independence of the judiciary. Different systems and mechanisms have been used to strike the right balance between these considerations.The collegium system did not retroactively invalidate appointments made before its introduction. Judicial decisions made by judges appointed under the previous system remain valid and legally binding.The debate over judicial appointments and reforms in this area continues in India. Various proposals and discussions have taken place regarding potential improvements to the appointment process, including increasing transparency and accountability.In summary, while the introduction of the collegium system was a significant step toward enhancing judicial independence in the appointment process, it does not necessarily render all appointments made before 1993 as “incorrect.” The issue of judicial appointments is complex and has evolved over time in response to various challenges and concerns. The collegium system is one of the many mechanisms designed to address these concerns, but it is not without its own set of criticisms and debates.The collegium system for the appointment and transfer of judges in India was introduced through a series of judicial pronouncements and not through a specific legislative enactment.

The collegium system, as it stands today, remains the predominant method for appointing and transferring judges in the higher judiciary in India. It is based on judicial interpretations and pronouncements, making it a unique and distinctive feature of India’s legal system.The issue of judicial appointments faced significant debate and controversy, leading to attempts to change the appointment process. The National Judicial Appointments Commission (NJAC) Act was passed in 2014 with the aim of introducing a new mechanism for appointments. However, in 2015, the Supreme Court struck down the NJAC Act, asserting that it violated the basic structure of the Constitution and upheld the primacy of the collegium system. The very fact that  the NJAC  was  struck  null  &  void is  itself a  violation  of  the  basic  structure  of  theConstitution of India as it is nowhere prevalent that justice chooses justice which may lead to favoritism to family members & friends. In the absence of a strict definition of the Basic Structure of the Constitution, it is well nigh appropriate to deduce that the Judiciary overstepped & violated the Basic Structure & tenets associated with it. The provisions as enshrined in Article 124 and Article 217 of the Indian Constitution were inviolable & power & appointment could not have been concentrated within a fold by one of the organs unilaterally. If that is true, all other constitutional & sensitive appointments may be determined by concerned departments under the same pleas of keeping interference of other organs let it be executive, legislative & judiciary. Judiciary alone cannot be accorded special status as fundamentally deemed non-interfering & neutral pillar out of three pillars. While preserving the independence of the judiciary is a paramount requirement, the NJAC with assimilated & synthesized composition would have offered a better & competent option within the ambit of the Basic Structure.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

12,"22 October, 2023 ","Rahul Gandhi spreads propaganda against Agnipath Scheme again by claiming kin of deceased Agniveer soldier will not get anything, here are the facts"," As per the Agnipath Scheme, the next of kin of Agniveer (Operator) Gawate Akshay Laxman, who died in Siachen, will receive receive ₹1.13 crore plus the Seva Nidhi amountDays after the Aam Aadmi Party tried to play politics over the death of an Agniveer soldier, now Rahul Gandhi has joined the dirty politics after the death of another Agniveer jawan recruited under the new Agnipath Scheme.On Sunday (22 October), the Indian Army’s Fire and Fury Corps informed that Agniveer (Operator) Gawate Akshay Laxman lost his life while posted at Siachen glacier. The corps posted on X, “All ranks of Fire and Fury Corps salute the supreme sacrifice of #Agniveer (Operator) Gawate Akshay Laxman, in the line of duty, in the unforgiving heights of #Siachen and offer deepest condolences to the family.”Quartered in snow silent to remain, when the bugle calls they shall rise and march againAll ranks of Fire and Fury Corps salute the supreme sacrifice of #Agniveer (Operator) Gawate Akshay Laxman, in the line of duty, in the unforgiving heights of #Siachen and offer deepest… pic.twitter.com/1Qo1izqr1UThe reason for the death has not been disclosed, but most tragedies in the glacier take place due to natural disasters like avalanches.Hours after the news of the unfortunate death of the soldier was published, Rahul Gandhi alleged that his family will not get any monetary payment, like the families of regular soldiers receive. In a tweet posted in Hindi, Rahul Gandhi wrote, “A young man was martyred for the country – no gratuity, no other military facilities during his service, and no pension to his family in martyrdom.”He further added that ‘Agniveer is a plan to insult the heroes of India’.However, the allegations of Rahul Gandhi are completely false and inaccurate, and families of Agniveer soldiers who loss their lives in the line of duty do receive emoluments. As per terms of the Agnipath scheme, the Next of Kin of an Agniveer soldier who becomes a battle casualty receives ₹48 Lakh as Non-Contributory Insurance and Ex-gratia of ₹44 Lakh.Apart from this, they also receive the amount of Seva Nidhi contributed by the Agniveer, with an equal matching contribution by the Govt, along with the interest. The Next of Kin will also receive pay for the balance tenure from the date of death, till the completion of four years, which is the term of employment under the scheme. In Gawate Akshay Laxman’s case, his family will receive over ₹13 lakh in total.Not only this, the next of kin will also be paid a contribution of ₹8 Lakh from the Armed Forces Battle Casualty Fund. Therefore, the next of kin of the deceased Agniveer soldier will receive ₹1.13 crore plus the Seva Nidhi amount, which could be around ₹3 lakh for service of one year, as opposed to Rahul Gandhi’s claim that they will receive no monetary compensation.It is notable that the Seva Nidhi contribution is 30% of the salary.Rahul Gandhi has been spreading false propaganda against the Agnipath scheme, designed to turn Indian defence forces into a younger force. He had claimed that the scheme was a brainchild of RSS, alleging that the scheme will create unemployed youths trained in guns, and will create violence in society. It is notable that Rahul Gandhi’s comments were the same as comments of PFI about the scheme, who had claimed that retired Agniveer soldiers would form groups to attack Muslims.Earlier AAP had attacked the scheme after Agniveer Amritpal Singh died in Kashmir, after he was not provided a military guard of honour during his funeral. The Indian Army had then explained that no guard of honour or military funeral was provided because Singh had died from suicide. The Army said that this is the existing policy for all soldiers, not just for Agnivereers.“Unfortunate instances of death arising out of suicide/self-inflicted injury, irrespective of the type of entry, are accorded due respect by the Armed Forces along with deep and enduring empathy with the family. Such cases, however, are not entitled to Military Funerals as per the extant Army Order of 1967, in vogue,” the Indian Army had said.Under the Agnipath scheme, Agniveer soldiers are recruited for 4 years, with 25% of them eligible to enter regular service. Soldiers who retire after four years will be opportunity to work at PSUs, government agencies, paramilitary forces, and state governments. They also receive the Sewa Nidhi corpus of ₹10.04 lakh along with interest.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

However, in the party's flag, there is a yellow olive leaves symbol and the words 'Welfare Party' in the middle panelAs Israel continues its military action against Hamas in Gaza in retaliation to the horrific terror attack on Israel by Hamas, Islamists and leftists worldwide, who are traditionally anti-Israel, are protesting against Israel and in support of Hamas and Palestine. A similar protest march in support of Palestinians was taken out by the Kerala-based Welfare Party of India in Kerala on Friday, 20 October in Palakkad in Kerala.However, when the photos and videos of the protest started appearing on social media, people started mocking the Welfare Party of India, saying that it was carrying the flag of Italy instead of the flag of Palestine. In the photos, the protestors were seen carrying a large number of flags which looked like the Italian flag.HILARIOUS: The Welfare Party in Kerala, India took out a rally in favor of Palestinians, but they brought ITALIAN flags instead of the Palestinian flag. 😂 #FreeItaly https://t.co/GKRCuyYuYUAs both the flags of Italy and Palestine contain the same colours, red, green and white, people assumed that the party mistakenly picked the wrong flag for the protest. The protestors were seen carrying a large banner saying ‘Free Palestine’, apart from the flag with green, white and red vertical bands.“Socialist stupidity and Jew hatred are once again proven to be a package deal,” tweeted activist and radio talk show host Charlie Kirk.Thousands of members of the Welfare Party in Kerala, India march with Italian flags mistaking then for the Palestinian flag, while holding letters that read: “Free Palestien”Socialist stupidity and Jew hatred are once again proven to be a package deal. pic.twitter.com/YLYAB4A53SMany other X users posted similar tweets, mocking the political party for carrying the Italian flag instead of the Palestinian flag.Welfare Party of India in Kerala took out this rally in support of Palestine but with flag of Italy. I sent this video to my Mallu friend to mock him. He replied:These people have Italian flag in hand but Palestine in heart. They also wave Indian Flag but with Pakistan in… pic.twitter.com/uUQOVVwDnVA mistake at a large pro-Hamas protest in Kerala, India, saw hundreds raising the Italian flag (🇮🇹) instead of the Palestinian flag (🇵🇸). pic.twitter.com/g3tcs277UIHowever, actually it is the people mocking the Welfare Party of India are mistaken, and the party didn’t make any mistake in carrying the flag. This is because they were carrying neither the Italian flag nor the Palestinian flag, they were carrying the flag of their own party.The flag of the Welfare Party of India has remarkable similarity with the Italian flag, as both the flags are made of vertical panels of green, white and red. However, there is a difference.In the Italian flag, all three panels are blank, but in the WPI flag, there are design elements in the white part in the middle. It has the olive leaves symbol in yellow and the words ‘Welfare Party’ written vertically in black inside the white panel.As the videos shared by the social media users are of low resolution, the yellow leaves symbol is mostly not visible against the white background. But parts of the words ‘Welfare Party’ in black are visible in some of the flags if the videos are observed carefully.Moreover, in other images and videos of the protest posted by the party and others, it is clearly seen that it is the party flag, not the Italian flag.In the video posted in the tweet below, which has better resolution, the yellow leaves symbol and black letters saying ‘Welfare Party’ are clearly seen in the flags carried in a pro-Palestine march by the party in Kozhikode.#Gaza_Genocide#IndiaWithPalestine: Massive rally in Kozhikode, Kerala – India by welfare party of India Kerala against #Israel's atrocities in #Palestine!Hundreds join in solidarity with #Gaza, chanting slogans like '#FreePalestine' and 'Stop #Gaza_Genocide'! pic.twitter.com/qE3ElKVkacTherefore, while the Welfare Party’s support for Palestinians is questionable given the horrific terror attack on Israel, the party didn’t make any mistake in picking the flag for the protest. People mocked them because their flag is almost similar to the Italian flag, assuming they were mistaking it for the Palestinian flag which has the same colours with the addition of a black panel.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

14,"27 October, 2023 ","Mehdi Hasan, who compared non-Muslims to ‘animals’, enjoys the hospitality of Tata, Shashi Tharoor and Rajdeep Sardesai: Netizens express disgust"," Mehdi Hasan had been involved in gaslighting Hindus by suggesting that he differentiates between the good and bad ones – a classical troupe used by Hinduphobes who claim ‘Hinduism’ and ‘Hindutva’ are different.Hinduphobic ‘journalist’ Mehdi Hasan has been invited as a speaker at the 14th edition of ‘Tata Literature Live! The Mumbai LitFest’. He is set to participate in two sessions, which are scheduled to be held on Friday (27th October) and Saturday (28th October). Hasan will share the stage with Congress MP Shashi Tharoor for an event titled ‘For the love of the Word- The Anil Dharker Session: Inauguration of Tata Literature Live! 2023 followed by in praise of the phrase.’He will participate in another session titled ‘Turn the Tide’ with ‘journalist’ Rajdeep Sardesai. The event will be held at ‘The Tata Theatre’, which is located inside the ‘The National Centre for the Performing Arts’ (NCPA) premises in South Mumbai.Today. In Mumbai. https://t.co/wGFi9HpvImThe website of ‘Tata Literature Live! The Mumbai LitFest’ describes the Hinduphobic ‘journalist’ as “the British-American host of The Mehdi Hasan Show on MSNBC and Peacock.” “He is the author of the New York Times bestseller Win Every Argument: The Art of Debating, Persuading, and Public Speaking. He is a former anchor for Al Jazeera English and has written for The New York Times, The Washington Post, and The Guardian, among other publications,” it further reads.The event is sponsored by Tata Steel, Tata Motors and is powered by the likes of Godrej and Kotak. The event has been hosted in association with ‘The National Centre for the Performing Arts’ (NCPA) .Hasan is infamous for his 2009 video where he was heard equating non-Muslims with ‘cattle’ and homosexuals with ‘paedophiles.’He was heard saying, “Once we lose the moral high ground we are no different from the rest, of the non-Muslims, from the rest of those human beings who live their lives as animals, bending any rule to fulfill any desire.”It must be mentioned that Mehdi Hasan is of Indian descent but was raised in England since childhood. Although he apologised for his remarks in 2019, it becomes clear that his upbringing in a diverse, multicultural society could not rid him of his disdain for non-Muslims.Gentle reminder that Mehdi Hasan has previously characterized non-Muslims as immoral people who “live their lives like animals,” and lumped homosexuals together with pedophiles and sexual deviants in his speeches: pic.twitter.com/ZX7b71EvSJIn April 2022, the MSNBC anchor went on a tirade against PM Modi and cast aspersions on India’s secularism.“Putin. Orban. Le Pen. We talk a lot in the West about the rise of far-right authoritarians and yet we never mention India’s Narendra Modi and his BJP. I did a deep-dive into India under Modi & new warnings of an anti-Muslim genocide,” Hasan claimed.In the video, he equated Hindu Nationalism in India (a nation that was divided on religious lines) with white Supremacy in the West, which is an ideology based on race. His sinister agenda was to equate Hindutva with Anti-Semitism.Putin. Orban. Le Pen.

15,"25 October, 2023 ","Siddharth Varadarajan’s wife Nandini Sundar, ‘Adolf Hitler’ and 1900+ others sign an open letter contextualising Hamas attack against Israel, where they raped and beheaded Jews"," The letter essentially negates that the Israeli attacks are a retaliation thereby further writing off the fact that Hamas ever conducted a terrorist attack on IsraelAs Israeli military action against Hamas in Gaza continues in retaliation to the horrific terror attack by Hamas on 7 October, some 1,900 plus odd sociology “professors” have signed an open letter in solidarity with Gaza and Palestinians. The letter, a typical rant of the left, calls to “contextualise” the Hamas terror attack that killed over 1400 innocent Israelis and displaced over 2 lakh civilians in Israel.The letter is published as a Google Doc, which can be edited by people after requesting edit permission. NEW: 1,700 sociology professors sign a letter accusing Israel of ""genocide"" and arguing that Hamas terror must be ""contextualize[d]"" as a response to ""75 years of settler colonial occupation and European empire.""Our professors are seething with hatred against the West. pic.twitter.com/4lxaftaepzThe excerpt reads, “As educators, it is our duty to stand by the principles of critical inquiry and learning, to hold the university as a space for conversation that foregrounds historical truths, and that contextualises this past week’s violence in the context of 75 years of settler colonial occupation and European empire.”The letter has been signed by professors from Ivy League institutes including Harvard, Yale, Princeton, Oxford, Brown, Berkeley, and others. And when the elite progressives have it in them to speak up for the downtrodden, how can the Indian left not rise to the occasion?We've scanned the list and found Nandini Sundar, wife of American far-left propagandist, Siddarth Varadarajn is one of the signatories supporting Hamas. Also includes students from IITB, TISS, OP Jindal, Ashoka Uni, JNU, Jamia Milia Islamia, AMU, DU. https://t.co/0k1q2okbup pic.twitter.com/Mtz71dUe19Among those Indians who have signed the letter are The Wire founder Siddharth Varadarajan’s wife Nandini Sundar. The Indian signatories to the letter also include students from IIT Bombay, Tata Institute of Social Sciences (TISS), OP Jindal, Ashoka University, JNU, Jamia Milia Islamia, Aligarh Muslim University (AMU), and Delhi University (DU).However, the biggest irony in this document is that a person named Adolf Hitler, who is listed as “professor emeritus, Sociology, University of Austria”, is also a signatory. However, it seems that later the name Adolf Hitler was removed from the list. It is notable that anyone can add any name to sign the list, and it is possible that some of the names are fake. Moreover, as it is an editable document, someone is going through the signatures and removing suspicious sounding names, like Adolf Hitler. Spotted this signature. https://t.co/1u2II2bW87 pic.twitter.com/QZBU5h470dMoreover, the letter does not condemn Hamas and the carnage it unleashed on Israeli civilians on 7th October killing more than 1,400 innocent people and taking more than 200 captive. It also does not mention that Hamas is also responsible for the death of civilian Palestinians in Israeli airstrikes in Gaza, as Hamas has been preventing civilians from evacuating north Gaza despite repeated warnings by Israel. In fact, the letter just once makes the mention of Hamas violence but does so in a matter-of-factly tone as against the 300+ words of Israel bashing.The letter reads, “While claiming its actions are a justifiable response to recent Hamas violence against Israeli civilians, it has targeted the civilian Palestinian population of Gaza, while exhibiting little regard for the loss of human life.” The letter also objects to the use of ‘racist and dehumanizing language’ for Hamas terrorists, referring to Israeli defence minister Yoav Gallant using the term ‘human animals’ for Hamas terrorists/Clearly, the signatories made the conscious choice of not acknowledging the unspeakable atrocities inflicted upon Israeli civilians including women and babies. One of the appalling excerpts of the letter reads, “This latest siege comes as a continuation and escalation of the daily violence Palestinians faced for decades from Israeli colonisation…”The letter essentially negates that the Israeli attacks are a retaliation thereby further writing off the fact that Hamas ever conducted a terrorist attack on Israel. That it consciously leaves out any mention of the terrorist attack and talks about the ongoing Israel-Hamas war in the context of “75 years of settler colonial occupation” shows how this global left lobby joiin forces with Islamists to legitimise the existence of terrorist groups like Hamas.Netizens have pointed out several flaws in the letter that raise questions on the credibility of the letter and even its signatories. There is of course the Adolf Hitler bit for one. “Academic Watchdog” Steve McGuire shared an image of the document while it was still accepting entries showing how the document has several collaborators.Captured some editing. pic.twitter.com/qT7wYQ8VEcX user Abigail Anthony, a writer, also recorded a 33-second video while the document was still being edited. The name of Michael Rodriguez, an associate professor of Sociology at the University of California, appeared on the document as he deleted an entry signed by the name Jill Biden, “professor, Northern Virginia Community College”.The apparent editor of the document goes by the name Michael Rodriguez-Muniz on X, formerly Twitter, and had first shared the open letter on 18th October calling on his followers to sign and share the same.Open Letter: Sociologists in Solidarity with GazaSign on and Share!https://t.co/xPLyic4welAuthor and Professor Bradley Campbell pointed out on X that the list consists of “mostly usual suspects plus a bunch of grad students. Some of them aren’t even in sociology departments.” 1700 sounds like a lot, but go through the list and it's mostly the usual suspects plus a bunch of grad students. Some of them aren't even in sociology departments. So things are bad, but not as bad as you might think. https://t.co/mOnyo1gvuDAnother X user, Grayson Quay, pointed out that the document can be signed under whatever name one wants. “They don’t vet the signatures at all. I just signed as Reinhard Heydrich,” he wrote.Do what you will with this information, but you can just sign this under whatever name you want. They don't vet the signatures at all.I just signed as Reinhard Heydrich. https://t.co/dFMyPTI1zuThis nth letter by the global left lobby comprising of 1,700 self-proclaimed “sociologists” whose credibility is as good as a troll account on social media, shows their sheer desperation to find an excuse of a “cause” to clutch on to. The left has become irrelevant, and Islam is their only fodder for the want of a revolution. Unfortunately, the victims of terrorism continue to have to fight for justice even in death.

16,"25 October, 2023 ",Islamists claim freed Israeli hostage was treated well by Hamas but here is what she said narrating her harrowing tale at the hands of the Islamic terrorists," The Islamists who cherry-picked her statement to claim that Hamas terrorists were humanitarians, conveniently failed to mention the details of her ordeal and the torture she faced at the hands of the terrorists. On Tuesday (24th October), the Hamas terrorists released two Israeli hostages among the 220 held. The two released women have been identified as Nurit Cooper, 79, and Yochaved Lifshitz, 85. It is being said that these two were released due to their deteriorating health conditions. While some of the Islamist and left-leaning media portals lauded the terrorists for providing the women with medicines and tea during their captivity, one of the women talked to the media after being released by Hamas terrorists to reveal that she went through hell and was beaten by the terrorists. Several Islamists and media channels released videos of the women being released by the Hamas terrorists and claimed that they were being offered tea and cookies. The Islamists also referred to the Hamas terrorists who launched a brutal attack on Israel on 7th October as ‘fighters’. One of the social media users shared a video clip by BBC News media which showed the daughter of one of the women praising the terrorists. The daughter could be heard saying that the terrorists treated her mother well and gave her medicines. “Another major blow to Israel’s propaganda machine,” the Islamist user tweeted.

IN PLAIN ENGLISH! #Gaza pic.twitter.com/khYqvWSclgSeveral media houses also painted the terrorists as ‘generous’ for providing the released hostages with tea and cookies. However, one of the released women talked to the media and said that she was assaulted and that she had to see hell on this Earth due to Hamas terrorists.🚨Hamas published a video showing the moment of the release of two female hostages – Nurit Cooper and Yochaved Lifshitz.

One can safely assume that any victim of such brutality when released from captivity, would be in shock. The victim would also feel gratitude for being released from captivity and in that moment, while still in fear by the torture inflicted, may make statements downplaying the brutality that she faced. However, for the Islamists to use that moment of fear to whitewash the crimes mounted by Jihadis only goes to show how desperate the ecosystem is to paint Hamas as good samaritans instead of the terrorists they are, given that they beheaded, raped, tortured and murdered over 1500 Jews. The Islamists who cherry-picked her statement to claim that Hamas terrorists were humanitarians, conveniently failed to mention the details of her ordeal and the torture she faced at the hands of the terrorists. While the Islamists tried to paint Hamas as good samaritans, the released woman identified as Yocheved Lifshitz, 85, said, “They beat me, laid me on a motorcycle, and rode through the fields with me towards Gaza. They brought me to the tunnels; we walked kilometres underground. They beat me in the ribs, even with sticks.” Further exposing the brutality of the Hamas terrorists, the woman said that she was abducted on a motorbike by the terrorists and her head was on one side and her body on the other when on the bike. “When I was on the bike, my head was on one side and the rest of my body on the other side. The young men hit me on the way. They didn’t break my ribs but it was painful and I had difficulty breathing,” she was quoted as saying. “I’ve been through hell … we didn’t think or know we would get to this situation,” she added. The large influential accounts who shared Hamas giving tea to the 85 years old hostages yesterday were only helping the murderous Hamas terrorists spread their propaganda. Yochaved Lifshitz, who escaped captivity by the murderers and Nazis Hamas-ISIS: ""They beat me, laid me on… pic.twitter.com/K3tiFlSwXwThe woman also stated that they were provided with only one time of meal and that barely included a cucumber and some cheese. ‘I was assaulted and beaten with sticks,” she reiterated. However, the released hostage revealed that the terrorists seemed prepared for this situation as they had everything in there that men and women needed including shampoo. “They treated us well and provided all our needs. They also ate the same food as they provided it to us,” the woman added. After being released, the woman could be seen shaking hands with the terrorists. On asking about it, she said that she did so because she was treated ‘well’ during the captivity and was provided with medicines. Notably, Lifshitz’s husband is still held hostage by the Hamas terrorists. It is important to note that the Hamas terrorists launched a brutal attack on the Jewish state on 7th October killing around 1400 Israelis and injuring several others. The terrorists raped the Israeli women, murdered and removed the body parts of the Jewish people, and also didn’t spare the elders and the children. The attack on Israel by the Hamas terrorists marks one of the most brutal attacks in history. After the attack by Hamas, Israel launched a counter-attack on Gaza last week. Ministry of Health in Gaza has reported over 5,000 Palestinians have been killed so far, including over 2,000 children and 1,100 women as well as journalists, medical workers, and first responders, with more than 15,000 injured. Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

17,"25 October, 2023 ","Congress-owned paper National Herald spreads hate against Gujaratis and Jains living in Mumbai, terms their vegetarianism as ‘food terrorism’"," This article in the Congress mouthpiece comes from the same Sujata Anandan who in her old posts on X (formerly Twitter) had attributed the glory of the courage of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj to the Mughals. On Tuesday (24th October), Sujata Anandan – the editor of the fraud-accused Congress mouthpiece National Herald – spread hate against Gujaratis and Jains living in Mumbai. In her article published in the Congress mouthpiece, she called the vegetarianism of Jains and Gujaratis in Mumbai “food terrorism”. Sharing her article on X, Sujata Anandan posted, “Go back to Gujarat if you don’t like the smell of fish and rice – Maharashtrians begin to reclaim their own state.”Go back to Gujarat if you don't like the smell of fish and rice – Maharashtrians begin to reclaim their own statehttps://t.co/UgXZMnU9q9In her article titled ‘Dietary apartheid: Mumbai gets a taste of food terrorism’, Sujata Anandan wrote, “Fish and rice are the staple of Maharashtrians and they don’t see why they should give up their diet to please later settlers, like the Gujaratis who hate even the smell of fish.”Villifying Gujaratis in her article, she described various incidents of what she called food terrorism and accused Gujaratis and Jains in Mumbai of targetting Marathis over food habits. She added, “In an incident in a Mumbai suburb, the Gujaratis were even more aggressive—they started dumping garbage at the doors of the Maharashtrian residents, even dog poop and cow dung. The majority of society in this case backed them up, completely ostracising the family and forcing the Maharashtrians out of the building.”She added, “This kind of food terrorism began in the late 1980s, when former prime minister Morarji Desai forced the shutdown of a non-vegetarian restaurant on the ground floor of his building, claiming that the odours disturbed his tranquillity.”In the guise of batting for the so-called just rights of Marathis in Mumbai, what Sujata Anandan peddled was nothing but an agenda to divide Hindus along various caste lines and regional identities. She wrote, “Social media posts by young Maharashtrians have been raging against the Shethjis and Bhatjis – Gujarati traders and priests – and calling to banish them from Mumbai and Maharashtra! Former Maharashtra minister Jitendra Awhad of the Nationalist Congress Party pointed out that the Kolis (fishermen), the Agris (who built Mumbai for the British) and the upper-crust Pathare Prabhus (who gave the city a cultural mooring) are the original inhabitants of Mumbai.”Notably, it is the same Sujata Anandan who in her old posts on X (formerly Twitter) had attributed the glory of the courage of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj to the Mughals. She had also posted that the armed forces of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj would loot and rape people. A case was filed against her in the Santa Cruz police station in Mumbai, based on the complaint filed by BJP leader Nitesh Rane. Now, to widen the social divide among Hindu communities, she has resorted to furthering the hatred against Jains, Gujaratis and other upper-caste Hindus calling their vegetarianism food terrorism. In the guise of presenting a case for non-vegetarian sections of the Marathi community, she is creating a social divide between the people of different communities living in Mumbai, by calling out particular castes and communities consuming vegetarian food as food terrorists.

18,"24 October, 2023 ","‘Did you remove diya because it was non-Islamic’: Arfa Khanum Sherwani gets slammed for tweet on Dusshera, others wonder if tweet was ‘Danish Kaneria effect’"," It is important to note that this post comes a day after former Pakistani cricketer Danish Kaneria asked The Wire ‘journalist’ Arfa Khanum Sherwani to migrate to Pakistan. He also challenged the senior editor of the leftist propaganda outlet to show any tweet that she had posted in support of Bharat and its culture.On Tuesday, the Wire ‘journalist’ Arfa Khanum Sherwani who peddles the leftist, Islamist agenda was slammed by netizens for editing a post she posted on the occasion of Dussehra. Sherwani initially tweeted wishing people ‘Happy Dussehra’ and added an emoji of a lamp (diya) which symbolizes the triumph of light over dark and good over evil. However, she later edited the post and removed the emoji of the lamp. After this, netizens slammed the journalist for editing the post and indicated that she removed the emoji may be because it was a Hindu symbol. One of the users with id @SmokingLiberals commented on the post and questioned, “Edit karke diya isiliye hataya kyunki non-islamic that? (Did you remove the diya emoji because it was non-Islamic?)” Edit karke diya isiliye hataya kyunki non-islamic tha? pic.twitter.com/HdN3Cqqo9rMeanwhile, another user also questioned the ‘journalist’ asking about what was the reason behind editing the post and removing the lamp from the original post. “Diya kyu hataya (why did you remove diya?” asked one @ShrivastavAni as he thanked former Pakistani cricketer Danish Kaneria for challenging the ‘journalist’ into praising the Indian culture the other day. Diya 🪔 kyon hataya ? Anyways thank you @DanishKaneria61 pic.twitter.com/WS0CCV2UCL“बस कर पगली …..” – @DanishKaneria61P.S. “🪔” delete kyon kiya?? pic.twitter.com/PcXkZLM7TvHowever, others indicated that this was the first time the ‘journalist’ had posted something aligned with the Hindu festival. They also indicated that this was because of Danish Kaneria who challenged the senior editor of the leftist propaganda outlet on October 23 to show any tweet that she had posted in support of Bharat and its culture.It is important to note that this post comes a day after former Pakistani cricketer Danish Kaneria asked The Wire ‘journalist’ Arfa Khanum Sherwani to migrate to Pakistan. He also challenged the senior editor of the leftist propaganda outlet to show any tweet that she had posted in support of Bharat and its culture.The saga began after Sherwani accused the Indian cricket fans of supposedly displaying ‘majoritarianism’ during the 2023 World Cup. Danish Kaneria then asked The Wire ‘journalist’ to leave India if she had issues with her Indian entity. Sherwani however accused Kaneria of posting communal trolls against her. After a series of tweet spat between the duo Kaneria then lashed out at Arfa Khanum Sherwani and said, “Let’s end the debate with a single answer – Just show me a single tweet in which you praised Bharat and its culture.” I am not taking about conversion, majoritarianism, Hindus, Indian Muslims or religion. I am simply talking about your ‘loyalty’. Got it? Let’s end the debate with single answer — “Just show me a single tweet in which you praised Bharat and its culture.” https://t.co/xtuZ06RL0KA day after this, Sherwani who probably never exchanged wishes on any Hindu festival, who believes that saying ‘Bharat Mata ki Jay’ is communal and a majoritarian slogan, wished on Dusshera tweeting, “Happy Dusshera”. While the tweet seemed to shock many of her Islamist followers, others slammed her for editing the lamp (diya) emoji from the tweet, which symbolizes the triumph of light over dark and good over evil on the Hindu festivals.

ASI officials said the new batch of 1,414 objects is likely to include non-antiquities as well, and will be ranked accordingly, keeping the definition of ""antiquity"" in mind.A batch of 1,414 antiquities is set to return to India from the United States. Reports citing government sources claim that the objects have already been given to the Consulate General of India in New York.The antiquities will include objects displayed in New York’s Metropolitan Museum of Art (Met Museum). Sources say that as per procedure, a team from the Archeological Survey of India (ASI) is being sent to the US for verification of the objects, after which the repatriation process can be initiated.USA offers back 1400 #Murtis and antiquities to Bharat. Literally the biggest restitution ever. Unimaginable before HPM @narendramodi Govt. 👏👏@kishanreddybjp @M_Lekhi 🙏#BringOurGodsHome @IndiaPrideProj https://t.co/KWSuiUSPxOThe ASI team will also authenticate the objects as “antiquities” or “non-antiquities”. ASI officials said the new batch of 1,414 objects is likely to include non-antiquities as well, and will be ranked accordingly, keeping the definition of “antiquity” in mind.No specific details regarding their age or region have been provided to the ASI at this stage. However, the US authorities have reportedly said that the 1,414 objects from different sources seem to be of “Indian provenance”.As per the Antiquities and Art Treasures Act, 1972, antiquity is defined as “any coin, sculpture, painting, epigraph or other work of art or craftsmanship; any article, object or thing detached from a building or cave; any article, object or thing illustrative of science, art, crafts, literature, religion, customs, morals or politics in bygone ages; any article, object or thing of historical interest” that “has been in existence for not less than 100 years”.Non-antiquities are generally decorative objects and idols, or replicas of original art objects used for ornamental purposes.A joint investigation by The Indian Express in March revealed that a treasure trove at the Met was traced to antique dealer Subhash Kapoor, who was serving a prison term in Tamil Nadu for smuggling antiquities.On 22nd March, the Supreme Court of the State of New York had issued a warrant against the Met giving the authorities ten days to seize the antiquities.On 30th March, the Met had issued a statement saying it would “transfer 15 sculptures for return to the Government of India, after having learned that the works were illegally removed from India”. 10 of the 15 items in the search warrant were flagged in The Indian Express report.Earlier, in July, the Indian government had said the objects from the Met were expected to arrive in the next three to six months. 105 antiquities were handed over by the US authorities to the Indian Consulate in New York on 17th July, and repatriated to India in August. The Met’s objects were not among them.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds. In name of saving democracy, they get money from various sources.

20,"19 October, 2023 ",Ram Mandir: 51-inch Balswaroop idol to be handed over to the Temple trust by 31st October," The Ram Lalla idols are being made based on the sketch of internationally acclaimed artist Vasudeo Kamath. He hails from Karnataka’s Karkala town and his paintings from the Ramayana series are acclaimed worldwide.The decades-long wait of Hindu devotees is going to end in January 2024. The construction work of the Bhavya Ram Mandir at Ram Janmabhoomi is progressing rapidly. In May, the Ram Janmabhoomi temple trust announced that three sculptors are making the Ram Lalla statue to be placed in the Garbhagriha. A member of one of the three teams, Vipin Bhadouriya recently informed that the 51-inch tall Balswaroop idol will be handed over to the Ram Janmabhoomi Temple trust by 31st October. Bhadouriya asserted, “The statue of Ramlalla, which will be placed in the sanctum sanctorum of Ayodhya’s Ram temple, is almost complete and will be handed over to the Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra Trust by 31st October.” Bhadouriya has been working around the clock with his mentor, Ganesh Bhatt, who is an eminent sculptor from Karnataka. Regarding Ramlalla’s idol, Bhadouriya noted, “Our idol made of black stone will be the world’s most beautiful statue of Lord Ram, more beautiful than what was imagined. The beauty of the idol would leave people mesmerised.” He further highlighted that the idol depicts a balswaroop Ram, as a five-year-old, standing on a lotus, carrying a bow in one hand and an arrow in the other. Additionally, the statue would also have fine carvings and designs. All signs related to Lord Ram are carved on the statue which will be 51 inches tall.Bhadouriya added, “I am happy that our efforts have yielded some good results. Our work is on the verge of completion. After some finishing touches, the idol will be handed over to the trust by the end of this month.” However, he is not the only one who is preparing the Ram Lalla idol. In May, General Secretary Champat Rai said, “The construction work of the idol of Ram Lalla has started. Dr Ganesh Bhatt from Karnataka, Satya Narayan Pandey from Jaipur, and Arun Yogiraj from Karnataka are making idols at three different places on three different stones.” #WATCH | Ayodhya, UP: The construction work of the idol of Ram Lalla has started.

It is expected that the idol… pic.twitter.com/0PBCgjXbP0According to the Trust officials, the finest Ram Lalla idol would be placed in the ‘garbhagriha’, while the remaining two would be placed in another temple. The Ram Lalla idols are being made based on the sketch of internationally acclaimed artist Vasudeo Kamath. He hails from Karnataka’s Karkala town and his paintings from the Ramayana series are acclaimed worldwide.Meanwhile, out of the three sculptors, two — Bhadouriya and his mentor Bhatt, and Arun Yogiraj from Mysore – have used ‘Krishna Shila’ (black stone) from Karnataka to carve the Ram Lalla idol. Krishna Shila is found in the vicinity of Karkala, a small town in Karnataka, approximately 60 kilometers away from Mangalore.According to the officials, the most attractive and durable sculptures are made with Krishna Shila as it is one of the finest stones used for sculpting. A trust official said, “The stone, weighing 10 tonnes, 6 feet wide, 4 feet thick, and almost one foot long, was specially brought from Nellikaru village in Karkala, almost a month ago.” Whereas the third team comprising Satya Narayan Pandey and his son Shilpi from Jaipur is carving the Ram Lalla statue from ‘A-class’ stone or marble from Makrana. Regarding the usage of Makrana marble, Officials said, “Makrana marble is used for its durability, translucency and fine grains. It is ‘weatherproof’, as it is resistant to erosion and weathering, which makes it ideal for outdoor sculptures and statues.”However, it is important to note that the trust is not using the two Shaligram stones, weighing 14 and 26 tonnes, which arrived from Nepal on 2nd January, for the construction of the Ram Lalla idol.Regarding this Champat Rai said, “The two Devshilas were gifted to us by Nepal. These stones were calcite and quartzite and were procured from the Gandaki River in the Muktinath area of the Himalayan region. However, after consulting many seers, priests, and experts, the trust decided not to use the Devshila from Nepal. It was a difficult decision to take.” The trust has not yet finalised what will be done with Devshila.Further, the Ram Janmabhoomi Trust officials also elaborated on the procedure that will be followed prior to the consecration (pran pratishtha) ceremony of the idol, in which Prime Minister Narendra Modi would take part, on 22nd January.According to the officials, a grand procession will be taken out through the streets of Ayodhya and the Ram Lalla idol will be placed on a special chariot that is under construction. The trust officials said, “The scholars from Kashi will worship River Saryu and give a holy dip to the idol amid the chants of special mantras and hymns. On the final day, the idol will be installed in the garbhagriha.”Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds. In name of saving democracy, they get money from various sources.

He had reached the Sharda Mata Mandir along with his followers on Rath Yatra from Kishkinda – the birthplace of Lord Hanuman in Karnataka.On 15th October (Sunday), the Sharad Navratri Puja was performed at the newly constructed Sharda Temple which is located in the Teetwal border region of North Kashmir’s Kupwara district, near the Line of Control (LoC).

22,"15 October, 2023 ","Navratri: Festival of women’s power whose religious, cultural, economic and scientific aspects are equally important, read the significance of Garba"," Garba is viewed as a representation of the universe and the 27 pores (9 in 3 lines) are interpreted as a depiction of the 27 constellations and each of them has 4 phases through which the number 27 X 4 = 108 is obtained.India is a wonderful country where all occasions and festivals are observed with grandeur. Diverse folk traditions are seen from different regions in this colourful country. The sophisticated and magnificent culture of affluent India is formed through the fusion of many indigenous customs. Sanatana Dharma’s core principle is that we are able to gain fresh knowledge throughout our festivities which offer a rational perspective as well and Navratri is one such event which falls on 15 October of this year. Let us tell you about Navratri’s cultural, religious and scientific significance and explain why it is known as the celebration of women’s power.Cultural and religious significance of NavratriNavratri has a special significance across the country, especially in Gujarat. The worshippers of Goddess Shakti observe a nine-day fast and play Garba during the nights. Many consider Garba as a form of entertainment which is performed for fun, however, that is not the case. Navratri has a special significance in spiritualism and is dedicated to the worship of Goddess Parashakti. It is not for enjoying and doing Garba and Dandiya only. Garba is but one method of worshipping Goddess Shakti and growing closer to her. The importance of dance has been described in the ancient Vedic tradition. There are numerous paths that lead to God and Garba is one of them. Therefore, it is first and foremost important to understand and accept that the Ras-Garba on Navratri is not just for leisure, but a vital component of our religious and cultural history.Religious history states that a demon by the name of Mahishasura once sat to perform penance for Lord Brahma. He demanded to be immortal after the latter was pleased and told him to ask for a blessing. However, he was directed to seek another one because immortality was against the law of nature. Afterwards, he requested a boon that neither a god nor a demon or a human could kill him and only a woman would be able to end his life which was granted.Mahishasura rose to power over time and eventually began waging war against the gods who fought unitedly against him but were unable to put a halt to his reign of terror after which Lord Shiv and Lord Vishnu were pleaded for assistance. However, it was not possible to defeat the demon because of the boon bestowed upon him. As a result, all of them including Lord Vishnu began to call upon Goddess Adishakti and a heavenly light that emanated from their bodies gave her a physical form.Mahishasura and Goddess Shakti engaged in combat despite the fact that he was destined to die at her hands. The war lasted for nine days and she defeated him on the tenth day and the festival of Navaratri came into existence ever since. Vijayadashami is commemorated after the conclusion of the auspicious nine days to mark the day the ferocious demon was eliminated. Notably, the day is also celebrated as Dussehra because Lord Ram killed demon king Ravan on the same day. Vijayadashami is an observance of the triumph of Dharma over evil.Scientific RelevanceThe scientific value of Navratri is linked to both its religious and cultural significance. The festival coincides with the intersection of two seasons which has scientific merit. There is a sandhikaal (end of one season and beginning of another) during both Navratris of the year. The body’s adjustment to speech, phlegm and bile generally goes through phases of improvement and decline during this time which affects the immune system. This is the reason that nine days are dedicated to chanting, fasting, purification of the body, cleaning, meditation, havan and other practices to prevent multiple illnesses and have a clean environment.Economic ImportanceAnother very significant aspect of Navratri is its fiscal impact. Hindu events also have a substantial economic component. The income of those who create garba and diyas (clay Lamps) begins to rise at the start of Navratri. Garba is a celebration of the festival of goddess that is participated in by all devotees and it provides employment to the people who make earthen pots and lamps.Moreover, the way people dress traditionally during Navratri is also crucial and benefits those who create the outfits. Several people find work through both little and large purchases. People who produce or sell snacks, sweets, fruits and religious items, for instance, have considerable possibilities for work during Navratri. Therefore, it is equally important to take into account the financial implications of the festival.Importance of ‘Women Power’The significance of women power outweighs the religious, cultural and monetary worth of Navratri by multiple factors. Adishakti pervades the atom and governs the whole universe. Feminity or power of women is also a component of the goddess. A person’s strength is their potential and no work is possible without shakti (power) which is of unique importance in the entire world. Hence, it is worshipped in different places in various ways. It’s recognised as power energy by science. It is known as Shakti or even divine energy in the ancient Vedic faith. According to the Rig Veda, the universe in its entirety originated with a singular power and per science the universe is composed of one energy. The power of women brought prominence to the world just as the universe has emerged from the primal power. Therefore, women power is regarded as an expression of Adishakti.Navratri also serves as a celebration of female empowerment. Navratri is also considered dedicated to women power. Girls are worshipped on the day of Durgashtami and Mahanavami on the occasion of Navratri as they are considered to be the form of Goddess Durga. There is a custom of worshipping one to nine girls between the ages of 2 years to 10 years during the festival.The entire cosmos could not have been created without Goddess Durga who is nature and divinity. She is oxygen and completes Lord Shiva. Shiva and Shakti come together to form Ardhanarishvar (lord who is half feminine). Since Navratri is dedicated to women power and respects them. The fast and Durga Puja would be futile if one offends his mother, sister, wife, daughter or another female during this festival. Hence, Navratri imparts the essential message of honouring all women.Significance of GarbaThe word Garba is derived from the Sanskrit word ‘Garbhdeep’. The popularity of playing garba among young people has elevated significantly in recent times. The popularity of playing garba among young people has elevated tremendously in recent times. If we look at the intriguing background of this well-known and fascinating folk dance, we discover that doing Garba was formerly only a tradition in Rajasthan and Gujarat (notably Saurashtra and Kutch). However, it gained popularity and spread to other parts of India. Now, people take part in Garba all around the country. Garba programs are organised in temples and houses. Nine holes are punched into Garba and it is placed in the centre and everyone plays Raas-Garba around it. Nowadays, large Garba festivals are hosted by various organisations in which people participate.The holes represent the shape of the human body while the lamp therein symbolises the flame form of the soul. The former indicates the nine doors of the human body which include the two eyes, two ears, two noses (nostrils), mouth, anus and genitalia. A person’s soul exits their body through any of these openings when they die. A lamp is continuously lit for nine days with the conviction that the self-flame is perpetually ignited.Apart from this, 27 holes are made in Garba in many places, however, the mystery of it is unknown. Garba is viewed as a representation of the universe and the 27 pores (9 in 3 lines) are interpreted as a depiction of the 27 constellations and each of them has 4 phases through which the number 27 X 4 = 108 is obtained. Therefore, it is believed that rotating the Garbi 108 times by placing the Garba in the middle is equal to the virtue of circumambulating the universe.Method and tradition of worshipNine forms of Goddess Durga are worshipped during Navratri. Each day is dedicated to the worship of a different form. The nine manifestations of the goddess are Shailputri, Brahmacharini, Chandraghanta, Kushmanda, Skanda Mata, Katyayani, Kalratri, Maha Gauri and Siddhidatri. Goddess Durga along with her family, based on religious beliefs, rode her Vahan (carrier/vehicle) from Kailash to Earth on the first day of Navratri. It is crucial to invoke the goddess during the Navratri fast. Invocation means inviting the deity into the house for a specific goal or accomplishment. The installation of the Kumbhasthapana or Kalash comes first in the procedure of worshipping Goddess Shakti. It must be installed if one fast for nine days during Navratri and should do the same even on the first or the day of Ashtami. According to the Devi Purana, it is very important to establish a Kalash in the house before worshipping Goddess Bhagavati. It is erected during worship as an image of the goddess’s strength and as a site of pilgrimage. The Kalash is viewed as a representation of wealth, joy and elegance. Lord Brahma, Lord Vishnu, Lord Shiva and the heavenly mother force all reside in it.The worship of Goddess Shakti can take place in multiple ways and there are numerous methods to do it which comprise yajna-yagya (ritual done in front of a sacred fire), havan (sacred purification ritual), vrat (fast), japa (meditative repetition of a mantra or a divine name), tapa (asceticism, spiritual discipline) and dhyana (meditation) among other things are performed. Chandipath, BhavanyaShtakam and Shakradaya Stuti have a very special significance in Navratri. Yajna is carried out during Navratri at any divine religious place. It is a method in the Vedic tradition that displays a profound mysticism and the culmination of spiritual power.Note: Read the report in Gujarati here.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

Residential properties of 2 NCP MLAs, Prakash Solanke (Ajit Pawar faction) and Sandeep Kshirsagar (Sharad Pawar faction) were set ablaze by the violent protesters in Maharashtra's Beed. The contentious issue of Maratha reservations has once again taken the central stage in Maharashtra politics as Lok Sabha and Assembly elections draw near. The long-going Maratha reservation demands in the state of Maharashtra took a violent turn on Tuesday (31st October) after the protesters demanding reservation in government jobs and educational institutions stirred violence in the city of Pune, Maharashtra. They raised the slogans of ‘Ek Maratha, Lakh Maratha’ and caused damage to the vehicles and public properties in the city. The protesters also blocked the Pune-Bangalore highway, the video of which has been going viral over the internet. #Pune #MarathaReservationVisual from #Pune #Bangalore highway, Maratha protestors have stalled the traffic movement demanding reservation for their community. pic.twitter.com/UB3PeBmYxTThis is a day after the violent protesters burned the houses of 2 MLAs in Beed district. Residential properties of 2 NCP MLAs, Prakash Solanke (Ajit Pawar faction) and Sandeep Kshirsagar (Sharad Pawar faction) were set ablaze by the violent protesters in Maharashtra’s Beed. The agitators also vandalised public properties after which prohibitory orders under Section 144 of the Code Of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) were imposed in the area. Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) MLA Prakash Solanke commented on the matter on Monday (30th October) and said that he and his family members were inside the house when the agitators burned his property.

On the other hand, the protesters also set ablaze the home of MLA Sandeep Kshirsagar (Sharad Pawar faction) in Beed. Several vehicles parked below his bungalow were also set on fire. The incident is said to have happened in the afternoon on 30th October. MLA Kshirsagar’s house was destroyed after NCP MLA Solanke’s home was set on fire. However, property belonging to MLA Solanke was destroyed after his previous comments against the Maratha reservation and quota activist Manoj Jarange Patil. Offices of former NCP MLA and minister Jaydutt Kshirsagar were also set on fire.#WATCH | Maharashtra | Maratha reservation agitators set fire to the NCP office in Beed City earlier this evening. Later they also set residences of NCP MLA Sandeep Kshirsagar and state's former minister Jay Kshirsagar on fire. Details awaited. pic.twitter.com/TcXSTsyuWmThe Maratha reservation issue was allegedly referred to as a kid’s game by the NCP MLA Solanke. He had also ‘ridiculed’ Patil by saying, “A person, who has not even contested a gram panchayat election, has become a smart person today.” This happened to irk the reservation protesters who turned violent on Monday and used fire as a brutal weapon. Maratha reservation activist Manoj Jarange Patil has been on fast for the past several days and has refused to conduct talks with the government. He has turned down requests by the government for talks. However, after the incident that happened in Beed yesterday, he said that he would discontinue the fast if the violence continued. While talking to the media, he also said that the protests were taking a different turn leading to violence. Meanwhile, as elections draw closer, the reservation issue in the state seems to have been fanned up. State leaders and opposition are racing to see Manoj Jarange Patil in person even though there is a high-level investigation underway to determine who is at fault for the recent wave of aggressiveness that resulted in violence in the Beed and Jalna districts. The opposition is pressuring the CM Shinde-led government to resolve the long-going issue of the Maratha reservation.

On August 29, Patil started a hunger strike in Antarwali Sarati village to demand an OBC quota for Marathas. Chief Minister Eknath Shinde gave him assurances, and on September 14, the strike was called off.As per the official, the trouble began on the third day of the said strike when the police attempted to shift Patil to a hospital on doctors’ advice. According to authorities, some people targeted private cars and state transportation buses. The police then dispersed the crowd in Antarwali Sarathi village, which is around 75 kilometers from Sambhaji Nagar, on the Dhule-Solapur road by using a baton charge and firing tear gas shells.Up to 40 police officers suffered injuries in the incident, including Jalna Superintendent of Police (SP) Tushar Doshi. More than 360 persons were booked under various sections of the Indian Penal Code, according to the police, and 16 of them were identified as having actively contributed to the violence.Notably, in May 2021, the Supreme Court overturned the state government’s reservation of jobs and education for the Maratha community, citing, among other things, the 50% cap on total reservations. Here is all the basic history, the current scenario, and all that you need to know about the Maratha reservation issue. The Marathas, a caste that includes, among others, landlords and peasants, make up approximately 33 percent of the state’s population. Although most Marathas speak Marathi, not everyone who speaks Marathi is a member of the Maratha community.Almost one-third of the state’s population is members of this politically powerful community. They have a reputation for being a ‘warrior’ caste with enormous land holdings. Twelve of the twenty chief ministers of Maharashtra state since its creation in 1960 including the current CM Eknath Shinde have appeared from the Maratha community.Even though the middle-class and lower-middle-class Marathas have become less prosperous over time due to land partition and agricultural issues, the community continues to contribute significantly to the rural economy. There has been a decades-long push for Maratha reservations. The latest push for OBC inclusion, however, appears to be a complicated one. The first protest seeking reservation for the Maratha community was led by Annasaheb Patil, the leader of the Mathadi Labour Union over 32 years ago. Since 1981, this reservation issue has sparked widespread demonstrations and has remained a crucial component of state politics.Unfortunately, Maharashtra, a state where Marathas have historically held political sway, has been unable to resolve this complex issue for the past several decades.Prior to the 2014 Assembly elections, the state government, led by Prithviraj Chavan at the time, introduced an ordinance granting Marathas a 16 percent reservation in government employment and education. It was based on the suggestions made by the Narayan Rane Committee at that moment in time.The Congress-NCP association, which ruled the state from 1999 to 2014, was overthrown in 2014, and Devendra Fadnavis’s government (BJP-Shiv Sena partnership) took over. August 2016, barely two years later, the state was hit hard by the Kopardi rape and murder of a fifteen-year-old girl who belonged to the Maratha community. The discontent among Marathas then resulted in organized demonstrations throughout the state, spearheaded by the Sakal Maratha Samaj and Maratha Kranti Morcha.However, in 2017–18, the protests turned violent. After that, the Fadnavis government took decisive action to address the complex problem. In November 2018, the government approved Marathas’ reservation under the Socially and Educationally Backward Class Act, an unusual provision based on the conclusions of the Backward Class Commission led by M G Gaikwad. By this, the BJP gained an electoral advantage over the then-rival Congress-NCP on account of the reservation.In an effort to strengthen its support among Marathas, the BJP also looked into reservation issues while MVA was in power (2019–2022). It paid off, as the BJP won the most votes in the local body elections. But opponents using Maratha quota politics are once again targeting Deputy Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis, who oversees the critically important home department today. Under the Socially and Educationally Backward Classes (SEBC) Act, 2018, the Bombay High Court affirmed in June 2019 the Maratha quota’s constitutional validity. While the High Court held that the state’s sixteen percent quota was not “justifiable,” it was lowered to thirteen percent in government employment and twelve percent in education, in accordance with the Maharashtra State Backward Class Commission’s recommendation.On the other hand, the HC stated that the reservation cap shouldn’t go above 50%. This restriction, however, may be exceeded in extreme and exceptional circumstances. It stated that this would depend on the availability of quantitative, current data demonstrating backwardness and inadequate representation, without compromising administrative efficiency.The 11-member Maharashtra State Backward Class Commission (MSBCC), led by Justice G M Gaikwad (retd.), was largely relied upon by the court for its conclusions. About 45,000 families from two villages in each of the 355 talukas where the Maratha population is greater than 50% were surveyed by the commission.According to the report turned in on November 15, 2018, the Maratha group lags behind in terms of social, economic, and educational advancement. The HC expressed satisfaction with the facts and noted that the commission had proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the Maratha group was socially, economically, and educationally behind. Additionally, it demonstrated that the Maratha minority was underrepresented in state government jobs.A five-judge Supreme Court Constitution bench led by Justice Ashok Bhushan overturned the Maharashtra law’s reservation provisions for the Maratha community in May 2021, citing the 50% ceiling established by the court in its 1992 Indra Sawhney (Mandal) ruling.Following the Supreme Court’s November 2022 decision upholding the 10% quota for the Economically Weaker Sections, the state administration clarified that economically disadvantaged community members would continue to get benefits under the EWS quota until the Maratha reservation issue was settled.After the SC denied the state government’s review plea in April of this year, the state government announced that it would file a curative petition. Additionally, the administration had announced the formation of a new, specialized body to conduct a thorough assessment of the community’s “backwardness.”The Congress, NCP, Sharad Pawar section, and Shiv Sena (UBT) are now pressuring the government led by Chief Minister Eknath Shinde to resolve the matter of the Maratha reservation in the state. They are pressuring CM Shinde and Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar to take action in favor of the community as the duo who belong to the community, are currently in power.After the violence in several districts, notably, Chief Minister Eknath Shinde announced on Monday (30th October) that the government has constituted an advisory group to look into the Maratha reservation issue. The body will be led by a number of former judges.“We have formed an advisory board on the subject of Maratha reservation under the leadership of retired Justice Bhosle, retired Justice Gaikwad, and retired Justice Shinde. This advisory board will give suggestions to the government on the matter of the Maratha reservation case in the Supreme Court. Along with this, we will also collect empirical data with the help of the Backward Classes Commission in the entire state. So that we can tell the Supreme Court in the curative petition that is pending how backward the Maratha community is,” CM Shinde was quoted as saying. For the sake of the Maratha community, the Maharashtra government declared it would grant Kunbi caste certificates to those Marathas from Marathwada who had documents from the Nizam rule attesting to their status as Kunbis. As of today (October 31), the Maharashtra Revenue Department has started to issue Kunbi certificates to Maratha community members who possess legitimate documentation.The state’s Kunbi community is classified as OBC given that they work in occupations connected to agriculture. If Marathas were granted Kunbi caste certificates, they would become recognized as members of the Kunbi community, receive OBC status, and be eligible for the reservations granted to OBCs.However, the other OBC groups are against Marathas being classified as OBCs for reservation privileges. OBCs make up 52 percent of the state’s population and are divided into 382 castes, whereas Marathas make up 32 percent.Chief Minister Eknath Shinde on Tuesday (31st October) assured activist Manoj Jarange Patil that a concrete decision would be taken in the cabinet meeting regarding the Maratha reservations. He said that the matter regarding giving Kunbi certificates to the Maratha community will also be discussed. CM Shinde also said that the government has filed a curative petition in the Supreme Court. Following a fruitful conversation with Chief Minister Shinde, Manoj Jarange Patil, who was on a hunger strike until his death in order to demand reservations for the Maratha community, ended the fast and consumed water. “The government has filed a curative petition in the Supreme Court for Maratha reservation. Therefore, I am hopeful that the Maratha community will get the reservation soon,” Patil said. #ManojJarange शाहू महाराजांचा मान राखून दोन दिवस पाणी पिणार, पण आरक्षण मिळालं नाहीतर पुन्हा पाणी सोडणार; मनोज जरांगेंचा निर्धार #MarathaReservation https://t.co/kCKQdlO0mhThe Police are said to have arrested around 49 people from Beed for engaging in the horrific violence.

24,"30 October, 2023 ","Pro-Palestine mobilisation in Maharashtra: 2 protests in Mumbra, 200 booked, minor children made to act like dead bodies in Aurangabad"," ""This is highly condemnable. Making children act in such a horrific manner for their agenda is dangerous. NCPCR has taken cognizance of the matter and will soon issue a notice in this case,"" NCPCR's chairperson Priyank Kanoongo told OpIndia. On Sunday (29th October), hundreds of Muslims gathered in the Mumbra and Thane region of Maharashtra’s Mumbai district to extend support to Palestine amid the ongoing Israel-Hamas war. The protesters raised pro-Palestine slogans and also called to boycott the products being manufactured in Israel. According to the initial information obtained by OpIndia, the protest was called by a forum named ‘The United Milli Forum’. The members of the forum are said to have organized the protest rally against Israel under the guise of offering prayers for the Palestinians. As per the report by India Today, the organizers had asked for permission to conduct the rally but the same was denied by the Thane Police Commissionerate.

The protestors also raised slogans against Israel and called for a boycott of products emerging from Israel. The videos of the protests are going viral over the internet in which the pro-Palestine supporters could be seen gathered on the ground in the Mumbra region of Maharashtra. They could also be seen raising placards against Israel and offering prayers for Palestinians.

Earlier, similar protests were organized in the Aurangabad district and also the Thane district of Maharashtra. So, notably, this is the second protest that has been organized by Muslims in Thane in support of Palestine. The first protest was organized by the Social Democratic Party of India (SDPI) in the Mumbra area where hundreds had gathered extending support in solidarity with Palestine. However, the protests were illegally organized so the police had booked around 200 persons in the case. Police said that the protesters defied prohibitory orders in the city while staging support to Palestine.

Later the Police happened to identify 16 persons but no arrests were made. The protesters carried banners and raised slogans against Israel in the city. As per the official, they shouted slogans in support of Palestine and defied the prohibitory orders in force in the Commissionerate.Similar protests were organized by the Students Islamic Organisation which is the student wing of Jamat-e-Islami Hind on 28th October in Aurangabad city of Maharashtra. The protests were organized at the Aam Khas ground where the Islamists raised the Palestine flags and also raised slogans against Israel.A huge crowd gathered in #Aurangabad on the call of SIO @sioindia to show Solidarity with the people of palestine and stand against the apartheid State of Israel and it's allies. #28thOct @siomsz #Maharashtra#IsraelTerorrist #HamasMassacre #IsraelAttack #PalestineGenocide pic.twitter.com/up34Dyp5ArThe General Secretary of SIO, Salman Mobin Khan; National Secretary of Jamaat-e-Islami Hind, KK Suhail, and Aetesam Hami, the Zonal President of SIO South Maharashtra addressed the gathering. The gatherers meanwhile called the Israelis ‘murderers’ and prayed for the safety of the people in Gaza. The videos of these protests also went viral over the internet in which the children were used to display ‘dead bodies’. As per the videos, the children were made to act like dead bodies and were presented as kids of Gaza by the organizers. Some kids could be seen wrapped in white clothes while others were painted in red colour to depict blood stains.

The NCPCR said that children being misused by the organizers in such a horrific manner is not at all okay and that immediate action will be taken against the organizers. “This is highly condemnable. Making children act in such a horrific manner for their agenda is dangerous. NCPCR has taken cognizance of the matter and will soon issue a notice in this case,” NCPCR’s chairperson Priyank Kanoongo told OpIndia. So far, three pro-Palestine protests have been organized in the state of Maharashtra and it is said that many more such protests are scheduled to happen here in the state. OpIndia talked exclusively to BJP’s Pratik Karpe from Maharashtra to learn that a similar pro-Palestine protest was scheduled to be organized by Islamists in the Marine Drive area of Maharahtra’s Mumbai. However, the protest was not given permission as directed by Dy CM Devendra Fadnavis. “Who are these people who are issuing support to Palestine when our Prime Minister himself has stated that India stands with humanity and with Israel? These protests seem to be politically motivated and somebody is deliberately sponsoring these protests. Maybe for votes. We have seen people from other political parties supporting terrorists earlier. One NCP leader had supported terrorist Ishrat Jahan. Also, they openly supported Palestine even after Hamas launched a deadly attack on Israel.”“Dy CM Devendra Fadnavis took cognizance of such protests and restricted one such event that was scheduled to happen in Mumbai. His office proactively looked into the matter and didn’t allow the protest to happen. The one that happened in Thane and Mumbra seems to be sponsored and politically motivated,” Karpe said. It is important to note that NCP leader Jitendra Awhad on 19th October had called out BJP and PM Modi for extending support to Israel. In a tweet, he said that Israel had become a human rights violator and that it didn’t deserve to be supported. He also justified the Hamas attack on Israel by saying that “the number of casualties of Israel’s army is far less than what Palestine has suffered.” Lack of factual knowledge is the biggest syndrome of BJP supporters in India. There's a total absence of the desire to learn as well. Their campaign _l support Israel_ is the major manifestation of this imbecility without knowing the history of Israel.India has always been in…The opposition parties in India also recently targeted the BJP-led government for not taking a clear stand on the Israel-Hamas war at the United Nations. This is after India abstained from voting for the Jordanian-drafted resolution that failed to condemn the terrorist attacks by Hamas. It, however, voted in favor of a Canada-led amendment to the draft resolution on the Gaza crisis which has sought to insert a paragraph condemning the ‘terrorist attacks by Hamas. While it is understandable for opposition parties to criticize the government and its officials, politicizing critical geopolitical matters for political gain is a sheer travesty. The fact is that India has been clear on its stance on the Israel-Hamas conflict. India has condemned the terror attack launched by the Palestine-backed Hamas against Israel and emphasized its commitment to diplomacy and dialogue over violence. India has made it sufficiently clear that it will never side with terrorism.It is important to note that the Hamas terrorists launched a brutal attack on the Jewish state on 7th October killing around 1400 Israelis and injuring several others. The terrorists raped the Israeli women and also didn’t spare the elders and the children. The videos of these horrific incidents were also made viral. The attack on Israel by the Hamas terrorists marks the most brutal attack against Jews after the Holocaust.After the attack by Hamas, Israel launched a counter-attack on Gaza. Over 5,000 Palestinians have been killed so far, including women and children as well as journalists, medical workers, and first responders, with more than 15,000 injured. IDF has been asking Gazans to move away from Northern Gaza but Egypt has closed the Rafah crossing and has declared that it won’t allow any refugees from Gaza.

25,"30 October, 2023 ","Dominic Martin, who took responsibility for Kerala blast, accuses Jehova’s Witness’ of having ‘anti-national beliefs’ which incidentally match radical Islam"," Martin reportedly said that Jehova's Witnesses ask the children not to sing the national anthem or join the defence services. ""They reach that all people of the world will perish and only they will live. What should we do with the people who long for the ruin of the entire people in the world? I could not find a solution,"" Martin said.The death toll rose to three in the Kerala blasts that rocked the prayer convention of Jehova’s Witnesses in Kochi, Kerala on 29th October after a 12-year-old girl succumbed to burn injuries during treatment.The girl, a resident of Ernakulam district, had suffered 95 per cent burns and was on ventilator support. Two other women, Leona (55), and Kumari (53) are among the deceased. More than 50 people have been injured in the blasts at the Zamra International Convention and Exhibition Centre at Kalamassery.Hours after the blasts, a man named Dominic Martin surrendered to the police claiming responsibility for the explosions. Before his arrest, Martin, a former member of Jehova’s Witness, appeared live on a social media platform and said that he believed that its teachings were “anti-national and seditious”.“Their teaching is not right. They are teaching anti-national things. I told them that they should change their ways. Staying in a…but cursing and addressing people in that country in the worst…derogatory form is they do. They are telling a 4-year-old child that if somebody from another community gives you candy, you shouldn’t have it. From an early age, they are feeding such poison into the child,” the accused reportedly alleged.He further said, “I took this decision because I understood that this organisation is bad for the country. Political parties won’t take action because everyone is scared of religion. You should open your eyes.”The Indian Express quoted Martin saying that Jehova’s Witnesses ask the children not to sing the national anthem or join the defence services. “They reach that all people of the world will perish and only they will live. What should we do with the people who long for the ruin of the entire people in the world? I could not find a solution,” Martin said.Jehova’s Witnesses, according to information available on their website jw.org, “strive to adhere to the form of Christianity that Jesus taught and that is apostles practised”. They consider Jehova as the one true and Almighty God, the Creator, who is the God of Abraham, Moses, and Jesus.According to information on jw.org, Jehova’s Witnesses do not participate in nationalistic ceremonies. “Jehova’s Witnesses choose not to participate in such ceremonies because we believe that these conflict with Bible teachings. We appreciate receiving the same respect for our beliefs as we show to others who make a different choice,” the official website of Jehova’s Witnesses reads. The group claims to remain “strictly neutral” in political affairs and “avoid affiliation with other religions”. Interestingly, a lot of these beliefs bear a resemblance to Islam in more than one way primarily owing to their Abrahamic origins.Islam and Jehova’s Witness, both propagate religion above nationalism making religious identity the unifying aspect of the community and not the country. This has been reflected in some incidents pertaining to the same.In 1986, three children belonging to the Jehova’s Witness sect refused to sing the National Anthem in their school in Kerala citing their beliefs. The children – Bijoe Emmanuel, Binu, and Bindu – were expelled from the Nair Service Society High School.However, the Supreme Court later held that forcing them to sing the National Anthem was a violation of their fundamental right to religion under Article 25 of the Indian Constitution.Similarly, a Muslim cleric forbade the students of a madrasa in UP’s Maharajganj from singing the national anthem on Independence Day in 2018. In a video that went viral on social media, the cleric was heard telling the students to avoid singing the national anthem because it is not “jayaz” (permissible) in Islam.The Uttar Pradesh government derecognised the madrasa and the UP Madrasa Board released immediate orders to suspend its licence and registration.According to al-islam.org, “the Quran has explicitly rejected the basis of nationalism”. It says, “To nationalism what matters the most is loyalty and attachment to the homeland, whereas to Islam, it is God and religion. Islam wishes all nations to regard the Quran as their Book, and the Ka’aba as their Qibla, and true leaders of Islam as their leaders.”The same is reflected in historical events like India’s partition in 1947, which was based on religious grounds to form a purely “Islamic nation”. The idea of the Muslim Brotherhood, which emanated from the Middle East, and has been the foundation of several terrorist organisations in the region also is a key example.Joining the armed forces of one’s homeland is also prohibited in both religions. Jehova’s Witnesses believe that “God alone deserves our worship”. Pledging allegiance to any symbol of nationalism is prohibited. “Jehovah’s Witnesses likewise feel that saluting the flag amounts to an act of worship, or idolatry, which the Bible prohibits,” the Jehova’s Witnesses state.Last year, a 24-year-old former Muslim cleric from Kerala revealed that Indian Muslims are taught to not join the Indian Army. During a press conference, Askar Ali said, “We were taught to hate other communities and not to join the Indian army as we will have to kill our own community members which is against our religious principles.”Jehova’s Witnesses, who consider themselves of the Christian faith, are also known to indulge in conversion practices, a practice vehemently followed in Islam, too. “People may face new problems or situations that they must deal with, moving them to take an interest in the Bible’s message. So we endeavour to talk to people on more than one occasion,” a statement on the website of Jehova’s Witnesses reads.Islam too openly preaches and practices conversion, stemming from Islamic concepts like Dar-ul-Islam. Several criminal incidents have taken place with the accused often attempting to convert the victim. This includes several recurring cases of love jihad or grooming jihad.Both Islam and Jehova’s Witnesses propagate that their respective gods do not approve of any other god and by extension, any other religion.Jehova’s Witness website says, “No, all religions are not the same. The Bible contains many examples of religions that displease God. These fall into two basic categories. Category 1: Worshipping false gods. Category 2: Worshipping the true God in a way he does not approve.”In fact, one of the reasons that they do not celebrate Christmas is because they believe it is “rooted in pagan traditions and rites”.Islam too fundamentally believes that there is no other god but Allah and that those who follow any other god than Allah and any other religion than Islam are “kafirs”.“Kafirs” means those who indulge in “kufr”. According to New Age Islam, an Islamic reformist organization, “The word Kufr means to reject faith in God, God’s signs, the prophets, the Holy Scriptures and the Day of Judgment. One who does not have faith in the unity of God and does not have faith also in other sacred signs of God is a Kafir, according to the Quran. One who rejects faith in God or does not have faith in God is called a Kafir. A Kafir may also be an idolater who worships gods and goddesses. According to the Quran, they are those who have gone astray. There are about 350 verses about Kufr and Kafir.”It adds, “In the majority of the verses, Kufr is non-belief in one God and prophets of God and in Holy Scriptures. Kufr is also worship of idols and gods and goddesses other than God. In some of the verses, the word Kufr and its variations are used to mean ingratitude for the favours of God. It is natural that if someone does not recognize God or does not have faith in God, he will also not acknowledge God’s favours but will attribute the favours to his gods and goddesses.”In May 2021, a petition was filed before the Madras High Court seeking protection for Hindu processions which were dubbed as “sins” by some local Muslims in the Perambalur district in Tamil Nadu. Several such Hindu processions have come under attack by Islamists with the most recent one being in Nuh in Haryana’s Mewat where at least five Hindus were butchered and several others injured.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

26,"27 October, 2023 ",Over the moon: ISRO has had a fantastic year so far. Here are its accomplishments in 2023," Designed and developed by ISRO, SSLVs offer a ""launch-on-demand"" facility for smaller satellites weighing up to 500 kg into low Earth orbit. SSLVs have proven to be a game-changer for ISRO in the small satellite launch market.In the year 2023, the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) achieved historic milestones in the arena of space exploration. Since its inception in 1969, ISRO has so far accomplished 125 spacecraft missions, 94 launch missions, 15 student satellites and 431 foreign satellites among its numerous successful endeavours. This year alone, ISRO has successfully carried out eight successful missions including the “universal history maker” Chandrayaan-3. Whether reaching the moon’s south pole or studying the sun, ISRO is achieving its diverse space ambitions that too in budgets less than Hollywood sci-fi movies.On 10th February 2023, ISRO successfully launched its Small Satellite Launch Vehicle (SSLV)-SSLV-D2 and placed the Earth Observation Satellite-07 (EOS-07) and two co-passenger satellites — Janus-1 and AzaadiSat2 — in a 450-km circular orbit around the Earth. Designed and developed by ISRO, SSLVs offer a “launch-on-demand” facility for smaller satellites weighing up to 500 kg into low Earth orbit. SSLVs have proven to be a game-changer for ISRO in the small satellite launch market.Designed and developed by ISRO, the Earth Observation Satellite (EOS-07) weighing 153.6 kg is used in various applications such as Agriculture, Forestry & Plantation, Soil Moisture and hydrology and Flood mapping. In this mission, ISRO added two new experiments mm-Wave Humidity Sounder and Spectrum Monitoring Payload. A detailed analysis of this mission can be read here.Consolidating its position in the market of commercial satellite launch, ISRO in March this year successfully placed 36 OneWeb satellites in low earth orbit (LEO) through its Launch Vehicle Mark-3 (LVM-3) M3. Notably, this was the second time ISRO launched OneWeb’s satellites as in October 2022, ISRO successfully launched the LVM-3 M2 and placed 36 OneWeb satellites in the LEO under the OneWeb India-1 mission. Interestingly, this was LVM-3’s sixth consecutive successful flight.It is worth noting that OneWeb Ltd (now merged with Eutelsat) is a UK-based customer of NewSpace India Ltd (NSIL), ISRO’s commercial arm and a worldwide communication network powered by space that enables governments and businesses to connect to the internet. Bharti Enterprises is a significant investor in OneWeb.Notably, with the successful placement of 36 OneWeb India 2 satellites in low earth orbit, NSIL executed its contract with the UK-based company to launch 72 satellites. ISRO accomplished the target by launching 36 OneWeb satellites in December last year and another 36 in March 2023.An interesting aspect of the Indian space agency launching OneWeb satellites was that initially not ISRO but Russia’s Roscosmos was supposed to launch the 72 satellites, however, as Russia entered into a war with Ukraine, the Russian authorities demanded that it would launch OneWeb satellites only after getting an assurance that it would not be used for military purposes against them and that the UK government would sell its stake. The UK, however, refused to fulfil Russia’s demands and thus OneWeb turned to India.Sunil Bharti Mittal, Chairman of Bharti Enterprises and founder of Bharti Airtel while speaking at the recently held 7th edition of the India Mobile Congress said that satellite communication is now available in India and will serve the country and the world. With this crucial technological leap in satellite communication India will usher into the era of increased interconnectivity with satellite communication linking even the most remote places, boosting development, and revolutionising the way the country communicates.Mittal credited “ISRO’s intervention” for this momentous achievement as he said, “With your intervention, we were able to get two rockets GSLV Mk 3 from ISRO to launch 72 satellites last year.”It is notable that Launch Vehicle Mark 3 (LVM3) was formerly identified as the Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle Mark III (GSLV Mk III).In April this year, ISRO stepped closer to its ambition of having its own reusable space vehicle as the space agency conducted a successful test of RLV LEX, an autonomous winged spaceplane. The mission was carried out by ISRO in Karnataka’s Chitradurga on 2nd April 2023.According to ISRO, the autonomous landing was performed under the identical conditions as a Space Re-entry vehicle landing – high speed, unmanned, accurate landing from the same return path — as if the vehicle arrived from space. Landing characteristics such as ground relative velocity, Landing Gear sink rate, and precise body rates, as experienced by an orbital re-entry spaceship on its return course, were obtained.The RLV LEX made use of various cutting-edge technology, including precise navigation hardware and software, a pseudolite system, a Ka-band Radar Altimeter, a NavIC receiver, indigenous landing gear, aerofoil honeycomb fins, and a brake parachute system. Moreover, for the first time ever, a winged body was carried to an altitude of 4.5 km by a helicopter and released to carry out an autonomous landing on a runway.In another successfully undertaken commercial mission by NSIL, the Indian space agency launched two Singaporean satellites TeLEOS-2 and Lumelite-4 through its reliable Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) on April 22 this year. The satellites weighing 741 kg and 16 kg respectively were placed in orbit. In addition to the primary and co-passenger satellites, the PSLV-C55 TeLEOS-2 Mission also included the PSLV Orbital Experimental Module (POEM) carrying out experiments with seven payloads attached to its PS4 upper stage. Notably, this was the 57th flight of PSLV and the 16th mission using the PSLV Core Alone configuration (PSLV-CA).The core alone (CA) model of PSLV was first launched in April 2007 when ISRO successfully launched its first commercial flight placing the Italian satellite Agile into orbit. In the CA model, six strap-on boosters are not used as is the case in the standard configuration of PSLVs. Moreover, PSLV-CA is less propellant.On May 29, ISRO successfully placed the NVS-01 navigation satellite into the Geosynchronous Transfer Orbit. The NVS-01 satellite is the first in a series of second-generation satellites planned for Navigation with Indian Constellation (NavIC) services. This series of satellites is aimed at assisting and enhancing the NavIC with improved capabilities. Notably, the NVS-01 carried an indigenous atomic clock for the first time. Along with the Ranging payload, it carried Navigation payloads.#WATCH | Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO), launches its advanced navigation satellite GSLV-F12 and NVS-01 from Sriharikota.(Video: ISRO) pic.twitter.com/2ylZ8giW8UAccording to ISRO, NavIC’s key applications included terrestrial, aerial, and maritime navigation, precision agriculture, geodetic surveying, emergency services, fleet management, location-based services in mobile devices, satellite orbit determination, marine fisheries, power grids, strategic and government agencies, and Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications.On 23rd August 2023, India scripted history by demonstrating its unparalleled capability of soft-landing on the south pole of the moon. With Vikram lander touching the lunar south pole at around 6:04 PM IST, India became the first nation to achieve this spectacular feat. ISRO’s accomplishment garnered global appreciation as the Indian space agency’s achievement holds the capability to bring about significant positive changes in the lives of people across the world.Chandrayaan-3 was the follow-up mission Chandrayaan-2. It comprised of Lander and Rover configuration. Chandrayaan-3 was launched by LVM3 from Satish Dhawan Space Centre in Sriharikota. The mission’s goals included demonstrating a safe and soft landing on the lunar surface, as well as roving on the moon and conducting in-situ scientific experiments. A detailed report on what is so “special” about the lunar south pole can be read here.Making a significant discovery, the presence of sulphur in the region was “unambiguously” confirmed by the Rover’s Laser-Induced Breakdown Spectroscope (LIBS) instrument. Other elements detected in the study included aluminium, calcium, iron, chromium, titanium, manganese, silicon, and oxygen.

When the Chandrayaan-2 mission failed, India did not lose hope although it was a moment when the whole nation cried but stood rock solid with ISRO. This support and strength was demonstrated by Prime Minister Modi who embraced K Sivan, the former ISRO chief as he broke into tears following the crash landing of Chandrayaan 2 in 2019. With the success of Chandrayaan 3, India showed the world, that there is no bigger motivation than failure.In July this year, ISRO successfully launched the PSLV-C56 carrying Singapore’s DS-SAR satellite including six other satellites from SDSC SHAR in Sriharikota. Notably, the core-alone model PSLV-C56 launched a DS-SAR satellite weighing 360 kg satellite into a Near-equatorial Orbit (NEO). The Singaporean satellite was launched with the objective to support the satellite imagery requirements of various agencies within the Government of Singapore. DS-SAR included an Israel Aerospace Industries manufactured Space Aperture Radar (SAR).After Chandrayaan-3 created history by landing near the moon’s south pole, ISRO launched India’s first solar mission, Aditya-L1, from the Satish Dhawan Space Centre in Sriharikota on September 2. It has seven payloads that will undertake extensive research on the sun. Four of these seven payloads will research solar light, while the remaining three will examine plasma and magnetic field parameters in real-time.PSLV-C57/Aditya-L1 Mission:The launch of Aditya-L1 by PSLV-C57 is accomplished successfully.The vehicle has placed the satellite precisely into its intended orbit.India’s first solar observatory has begun its journey to the destination of Sun-Earth L1 point.After reaching its destination 1.5 million kilometres from Earth, Aditya-L1 would be placed in a halo orbit around Lagrange Point 1 (L1). The journey is projected to take four months to complete. Aditya-L1 would orbit the Earth facing the Sun at a distance of around 1.5 million kilometres, or 1% of the distance between the Earth and the Sun. Aditya L-1 has completed four earth-bound manoeuvres. According to ISRO, the spacecraft has escaped the sphere of Earth’s influence, on its way to the Sun-Earth Lagrange Point 1. The objectives of the mission included the study of the upper atmospheric dynamics (chromospheres and corona) of the Sun, the study of the chromospheric and coronal heating, the physics of the partially ionised plasma and the initiation of coronal mass ejections and flares. Moreover, the mission also aimed to observe the in-situ particle and plasma environment, providing data for studying particle dynamics from the Sun. OpIndia report on Aditya L-1 mission, its objectives, significance and other specifics can be read here.Moving forward relentlessly to accomplish its diverse space ambitions, ISRO is preparing for unmanned flight tests of the mission’s ‘crew escape system’. The Indian space agency recently announced that it will soon commence the unmanned flight tests for the Gaganyaan mission as the first development flight Test Vehicle (TV-D1) is in the final stages of preparation. Mission Gaganyaan:ISRO to commence unmanned flight tests for the Gaganyaan mission. Preparations for the Flight Test Vehicle Abort Mission-1 (TV-D1), which demonstrates the performance of the Crew Escape System, are underway.https://t.co/HSY0qfVDEH @indiannavy #Gaganyaan pic.twitter.com/XszSDEqs7wISRO will launch a crew of two to three members into a circular orbit 400 kilometres above Earth as part of the Gaganyaan project. The mission will take one to three days and will focus on assuring their safe return to Earth. ISRO is making India a prominent global force and making India proud with their persistent endeavours to propel India to the top of the space exploration and commercial satellite launch markets.

27,"31 October, 2023 ","Chandrababu Naidu walks out of Rajahmundry jail, thanks supporters for “prayers and affection”"," The TDP supremo has been ordered to not participate in any other program except his medical check-ups at the hospital.Former Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister Chandrababu Naidu walked out of Rajahmundry jail on Tuesday after Andhra Pradesh High Court granted bail to him in the alleged Skill Development case.After walking out of the central cell, Chandrababu Naidu said, “When I was in trouble, you all came on the roads and prayed for me. I will never forget the affection shown to me, not only in Andhra Pradesh but also in Telangana and across the world.”“In my 45 years of career, I haven’t committed any mistake and will not let anyone do. All the political parties have supported me, all thanks to them,” he added.Chandrababu Naidu was under 53 days of judicial custody. The interim bail has been granted for four weeks. TDP said that the ruling YSRCP has failed in its attempt to label Chandrababu Naidu as a criminal.“Despite all the efforts by the ruling YSRCP to constantly put N Chandrababu Naidu under scrutiny and label him as a criminal, they finally failed today. This shows how the YSRCP is afraid, scared, intimated and terrified of TDP,” the party said.Chandrababu Naidu was granted bail due to health reasons. He has been ordered to surrender on November 24. The court will hear arguments on the main bail petition on November 10. The TDP supremo has been ordered to not participate in any other program except his medical check-ups at the hospital.The TDP supremo has been ordered to not participate in any other program except his medical check-ups at the hospital. The High Court also ordered Naidu to not participate in Media and Political activities.Meanwhile Andhra Pradesh Bharatiya Janata Party chief Daggubati Purandeswari on Tuesday welcomed the state High Court’s decision to grant interim bail to Telugu Desam Party supremo N Chandrababu Naidu in connection with the skill development case. The Andhra Pradesh BJP chief, however, condemned the arrest of Naidu saying that the crackdown on September 9 was not done in an appropriate way.“We welcome the judgement of the (Andhra Pradesh) High Court for granting interim bail to Chandrababu Naidu. We condemn his arrest as it was not done in an appropriate way. They have made a mistake in the past by arresting without giving notice or without conducting an investigation. The method of arrest without adding his name to the FIR is also not the appropriate way. (But) It is a good sign to get interim bail,” Purandeswari said. (This news report is published from a syndicated feed.

28,"31 October, 2023 ","Opposition MPs supposedly get ‘state-sponsored attack’ notification from Apple, govt orders probe: How Apple itself says their notifications are unreliable"," Interestingly, Apple itself on its website states that these so-called ""state-sponsored threats"" to their users' devices are not reliable.In a new political potboiler, some iPhone-using Opposition leaders have claimed to have received “threat alerts” from Apple. “ALERT: State-sponsored attackers may be targeting your iPhone,” the threat notification sent on iMessage and Apple Mail reads.The notification has reportedly been received by Opposition leaders across party lines including Mahua Moitra, Shashi Tharoor, Pawan Khera, KC Venugopal, Priyanka Chaturvedi, Raghav Chadha, Asaduddin Owaisi, and some others.Taking to X, formerly Twitter, Congress MP Shashi Tharoor wrote, “Received from an Apple ID, [email protected], which I have verified. Authenticity confirmed. Glad to keep underemployed officials busy at the expense of taxpayers like me! Nothing more important to do? @PMOIndia @INCIndia @kharge @RahulGandhi.”Received from an Apple ID, [email protected], which I have verified. Authenticity confirmed. Glad to keep underemployed officials busy at the expenses of taxpayers like me! Nothing more important to do?@PMOIndia @INCIndia @kharge @RahulGandhi pic.twitter.com/5zyuoFmaIaInterestingly, Shashi Tharoor had tweeted once before with the screenshot of the email he received, however, in that screenshot, he had forgotten to mask his email ID associated with his Apple ID. Tharoor later deleted the tweeted ad re-posted the screenshot with his email masked. Ironically, it would certainly not take sophisticated state-sponsored hackers to break into the device security of someone, an MP no less, who is not aware of basic protocols that one must follow to keep their devices safe – like not making public vital details attached to your accounts. Similarly dramatic responses were seen coming from Pawan Khera on X, who put the onus of the alleged “threat” on PM Modi saying, “Dear Modi Sarkar, why are you doing this?”Dear Modi Sarkar, why are you doing this? pic.twitter.com/3hWmAx00qlTrinamool Congress MP Mahua Moitra, who recently confessed to giving her Parliamentary login credentials to Darshan Hiranandani who submitted questions against Adani, wrote on X calling Adani and PMO bullies.Received text & email from Apple warning me Govt trying to hack into my phone & email. @HMOIndia – get a life. Adani & PMO bullies – your fear makes me pity you. @priyankac19 – you, I , & 3 other INDIAns have got it so far . pic.twitter.com/2dPgv14xC0“Received text & email from Apple warning me Govt trying to hack into my phone & email. @HMOIndia – get a life. Adani & PMO bullies – your fear makes me pity you. @priyankac19 – you, I, & 3 other INDIAns have got it so far,” Moitra wrote.Notably, the TMC MP has been told to appear before the Lok Sabha Ethics Committee on 2nd November in the cash-for-query case. The case pertains to allegations by BJP MP Nishikant Dubey that Moitra accepted bribes and favours from Darshan Hiranandani including uber-expensive handbags costing up to lakhs of rupees.On 27th October, Moitra accepted that she shared her Parliament login details with the businessman but denied taking any money for it.Meanwhile, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi rushed to conduct a press conference to blame the BJP over the alert. He said, “A number of people in my office have got this message… In Congress, KC Venugopal ji, Supriya, Pawan Khera have got it too…They (BJP) are trying to distract the attention of the youth.”#WATCH | Multiple opposition leaders allege 'hacking' of their Apple devices, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi says, ""A number of people in my office have got this message… In Congress, KC Venugopal ji, Supriya, Pawan Khera have got it too…They (BJP) are trying to distract the… pic.twitter.com/1euRYvAL6oWhile Rahul Gandhi rushed to play politics, it is pertinent to note that some others who certainly can’t be seen as I.N.D.I Alliance members also received the same threat alert message. Samir Saran, who is the President of ORF, a non-partisan, independent think tank also received the threat alert message from Apple. Was notified by Apple late last night that my iPhone linked to my Apple ID is being targeted … I have implemented the on-device remedial measures suggested by Apple and am reaching out to experts as well …. pic.twitter.com/x9KbvcV1ezAdditionally, the same notification has reportedly been received by some Apple iPhone users in Armenia. Screenshots of the same alert were shared by Armenian journalist Artur Papyan @ditord on X. “Apple has issued a new round of threat notifications about State Sponsored attacks. If you’re an Armenia-based journalist or a civil society representative, contact me, @Kornelij or @RubenMuradyan to get your device checked, as well as urgent advice and support,” Papyan posted on X.Apple has issued a new round of threat notifications about State Sponsored attacks. If you're an Armenia-based journalist or a civil society representative, contact me, @Kornelij or @RubenMuradyan to get your device checked, as well as urgent advice and support. pic.twitter.com/kM8DbZKPKPInterestingly, Apple itself on its website states that these so-called “state-sponsored threats” to their users’ device are not reliable.In fact, the very alert that the Opposition leaders claimed to have received states, “While it’s possible this is a false alarm, please take this warning seriously.”Furthermore, Apple has implied that it does not attribute the threat notifications to any specific state-sponsored attacker. “State-sponsored attackers are very well-funded and sophisticated, and their attacks evolve over time. Detecting such attacks relies on threat intelligence signals that are often imperfect and incomplete.”“It’s possible that some Apple threat notifications may be false alarms, or that some attacks are not detected. We are unable to provide information about what causes us to issue threat notifications, as that may help state-sponsored attackers adapt their behaviour to evade detection in the future,” Apple states on the support page on its website.Moreover, it says that Apple is “unable to provide information about what causes us to issue threat notifications”. This means that it is not clear whatsoever whether the alleged attack, that is if it is indeed an attack, is state-sponsored at all. And even if it is “state-sponsored” then there is no telling which state.In fact, after the dramatic press conference of Rahul Gandhi where he directly blamed the Modi government of snooping on “opposition members”, Apple issued a stetement reiterating their position on such threat messages. ""Apple does not attribute the threat notifications to any specific state-sponsored attacker. State-sponsored attackers are very well-funded and sophisticated, and their attacks evolve over time. Detecting such attacks relies on threat intelligence signals that are often imperfect… https://t.co/Bvmi5G1pQ4Apple said, “Apple does not attribute the threat notifications to any specific state-sponsored attacker. State-sponsored attackers are very well-funded and sophisticated, and their attacks evolve over time. Detecting such attacks relies on threat intelligence signals that are often imperfect and incomplete. It’s possible that some Apple threat notifications may be false alarms, or that some attacks are not detected. We are unable to provide information about what causes us to issue threat notifications, as that may help state-sponsored attackers adapt their behavior to evade detection in the future”. According to information available on the tech-giant’s website, “Apple threat notifications are designed to inform and assist users who may have been targeted by state-sponsored attackers.”“These users are individually targeted because of who they are or what they do. Unlike traditional cybercriminals, state-sponsored attackers apply exceptional resources to target a very small number of specific individuals and their devices, which makes these attacks much harder to detect and prevent. State-sponsored attacks are highly complex, cost millions of dollars to develop and often have a short shelf life. The vast majority of users will never be targeted by such attacks,” the company states.Apple has also laid down measures to prevent and combat such threats. “To verify that an Apple threat notification is genuine, sign in to appleid.apple.com. If Apple has sent you a threat notification, it will be clearly visible at the top of the page after you have signed in.”After the fiasco, the Modi government has ordered a probe into the alleged security breach. Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw said, “We are concerned by the statements we have seen in media from some MPs as well as others about a notification received by them from Apple. The notification received by them as per media reports mentions about ‘state-sponsored attacks’ on their devices”. He further said, “Information by Apple on this issue seems vague and non-specific in nature. Apple states these notifications may be based on information which is ‘incomplete or imperfect’. It also states that some Apple threat notifications may be false alarms or some attacks are not detected. Apple has also claimed that Apple IDs are securely encrypted on devices, making it extremely difficult to access or identify them without the user’s explicit permission. This encryption safeguards the user’s Apple ID and ensures that it remains private and protected. The Government of Bharat takes its role of protecting the privacy and security of all citizens very seriously and will investigate to get to the bottom of these notifications. In light of such information and widespread speculation, we have also asked Apple to join the investigation with real, accurate information on the alleged state-sponsored attacks”. On 25th August last year, the Supreme Court said that no conclusive proof emerged to support the claim that the Indian government was using the controversial Pegasus spyware to snoop on people.The then Chief Justice of India NV Ramana said that the apex court-appointed committee probing the matter has concluded that the Israeli spyware was not found in the 29 mobile phones it examined.The controversy erupted on 18th July 2021, when a group of media networks and investigative reporters claimed that among the 50,000 phone numbers chosen for infection with the Pegasus malware were those of Indian ministers, legislators, activists, entrepreneurs, and journalists.Notably, Israel-based company NSO which built the spyware, claims that it only deals with governments and not private entities. However, it never disclosed who its clients were. Several international media outlets, including The Wire from India, released a series of reports claiming the Indian government used the spyware.The reports were based on an “analysis” done by a team of Amnesty International. It is notable that the Supreme Court-appointed committee had also used the tool develop by Amnesty to detect the spyware, along with various other tools.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

While Senior Advocate Sankarnaryan appearing for Mahua Moitra, was putting forth his submisisons, Adv Jai Anant Dehradrai, against whom also injunction was sought, objected to him appearing in the case.Dehedrai appeared in person and told the court that Sankaranarayanan contacted him the night before and asked him to withdraw his CBI complaint in exchange for the dog. Following these submissions, Sankarnaryan withdrew from the case.Speaking to the media outside the court complex Gopal Sankarnaryan said “I have absolutely no comments except to say, because Jai (Advocate Jai Anant Dehadrai) instructed me in a case, I had reached out to him yesterday and had asked him is there were any way of exploring a settlement. Jai had said that he would get back to me, but he didn’t. Today when I appeared, Jai personally said to me he had an objection to my appearance. I immediately withdrew and said that I don’t want to do this case.”The Delhi High Court earlier had issued notices to the defendants on Moitra’s suit. Moitra is at the centre of a political storm after BJP MP Nishikant Dubey complained to Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla that she had allegedly taken bribes from a business house to ask questions in Parliament.Earlier Nishikant Dubey in his letter to the Lok Sabha Speaker, titled “Reemergence of nasty ‘Cash for Query’ in Parliament” had alleged “‘serious Breach of Privilege’, ‘Contempt of the House’ and a ‘Criminal Offence’ under Section 120A of IPC” by the Trinamool Congress MP.Dubey claimed that an Advocate, Jai Anant Dehadrai had provided him with proof of a bribe.

Israel has been conducting strikes on Hamas and its terror infrastructure in Gaza in retaliation to the deadly terrorist attacks on 7th October.The controversial statement from the SP MP is not a first. The Samajwadi Party MP has made communal statements over several issues in the past. In September, Rahman demanded that there should be space to offer Namaz in the new Parliament building.In February this year, he asserted that India has never been and would never be a ‘Hindu Rashtra’ and claimed that Islam is the only true religion.In October 2022, Shafiqur Rahman Barq went on a misogynistic rant and claimed that allowing women to walk without a burqa in public would only enhance wildness and promiscuity in men. He had also asserted that chanting Vande Mataram was against the tenets of Islam.The Samajwadi Party leader was earlier booked for hailing the Taliban and comparing the radical Islamist outfit to Indian freedom fighters. He was also booked in connection to violent protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) in Sambhal district of Uttar Pradesh.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

32,"28 October, 2023 ",Israel-Hamas war: How propaganda pieces in media are used to generate sympathy for Hamas while demonising Israel," As the days pass on, we find the memories of the dead fades, the sudden shock at the sheer audaciousness of the attack and the disbelief at the celebration of death in certain quartersOn 7th of October, 2023, hundreds ot arms-wielding men, landed in Israel, as the people were celebrating Yom Kippur, the Jewish festival of repentance, confessions and forgiveness. The men belonged to Hamas (Harkat-ul-Muqawama al-Islamiya or Islamic Resistance Group), a group designated by many countries as a terror organisation and has officially claimed involvement in several terror acts in the region.The audacious attack left more than 1400 unsuspecting Israeli citizens dead, many wounded and over 200 were carried back to the Hamas-controlled areas of Gaza as hostages. Among the dead, were music lovers who were attending a concert for Peace, infants and kids, as per Israel Government, brutally beheaded and burned down.The world watched in horror as reports of common civilians, those who march around crying Islamophobia across the world, like the famous Latifa AbouChakra of UK (She has been hailed in the past as the face of Muslims persecuted by Europeans in Europe where she lives as a refugee, in the name of Islamophobia), were caught cheering up these inhuman killings fancifully calling these unprecedented and brutal killing Resistance or Intifada hailing it as a moment of triumph.Considering the population of Israel, the US called these killings on proportionate basis, a 9-11, many times over. The details are gory and too many, covered too widely across several media reports.What my objective here is not to repeat the gruesome details and broad silence of Muslims as far as condemning the heinous terror act is concerned. As the days pass on, we find the memories of the dead fades, the sudden shock at the sheer audaciousness of the attack and the disbelief at the celebration of death in certain quarters, not among the uneducated and deprived, rather among the intellectuals and the privileged die down.With this those who stayed mum in the face of very human and instinctive outrage at the 7th of October killings in Israel, tried to find voice with a Hospital attack but it turned out to be a failed rocket attack by Hamas terrorist which caused the misguided missile land in the parking lot of the ill-fated hospital. This clever game of creating fake narrative has been going on for decades and may be centuries but this time, with the prevalence on unorganised media in democratised digital world, the lies were getting caught as quickly as they were floated.Noted journalist Tavleen Singh, a known Modi-critic, wrote attacking Hamas, and was hounded by islamists for that. The hospital attack, which the Hamas-sympathisers tried to use to counter the inhuman killings of 7th October, turned out to be their own doing and took the wind out of the neatly floated Palestine propaganda balloon.However, after initial dilli-dally, Indian National Congress came out with vague statement and then again went into silence. One would have thought that they have run out of their interest in a foreign event, given that elections are around in India. But then as if on cue, Priyanka Vadra tweeted, lamenting on deaths in Gaza, totally ignoring the first event which triggered this revenge violence of a recognised state against a recognised terror organisation.Then I read a piece in today’s (28th October, 2023, Indian Express) by Farah Naqvi, who is mentioned as independent writer and activist, much like Latifa Abouchakra of Britain. In her piece titled Amid Crisis, fear-mongering, she tries to rebut another piece by Yeshaya Rosenman,  a Jewish journalist. Farah Naqvi was incidentally also a member of National Advisory Council of Sonia Gandhi during Congress-led UPA Government, which was an unconstitutional body operating over the elected parliament of India with Sonia Gandhi as quasi-head of the Government of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh.Farah Naqvi, is the daughter of a noted journalist, Saeed Naqvi. In the account of her father’s brush with Covid where he survived, getting oxygen, hospital bed and medical attention with struggle (many did not get and lost their lives too), she finds a place to mention Democracy index and other political points, about how things are wrong with India which eventually saved her father, in spite of pandemic which left a global devastation of hitherto unseen proportions. But then that is how intellectuals in India play. Politics come easy to them and gratitude comes with difficulty.Coming back to the current piece, she writes starting from taking the count of dead Palestinians. On the day when Palestinian death toll crossed 7000. This is based on the report given out by the Health Ministry of Hamas controlled Gaza. These casualty figures mentioned in the Indian Express article by Ms. Naqvi have been disputed by the US authorities. That notwithstanding, the dead in Ms Naqvi articles mention only Palestinians, totally ignoring 1400 dead Israelis. She mocks how in the words of the Jewish journalist, who has actually more stake in the conflict perpetrated by Hamas, War Crimes are moral actions, resistance is aggression and occupied and occupier are same-to-same. This is where it gets clever. She has in one sentence called the response of a sovereign state to the killing of her citizens by a terror-group- war crime, mass-manslaughter by the terror group as Resistance, and called the Jewish who were rehabilitated in their ancient lands by a UN mandate, after the sufferings and genocide in Hitler’s holocaust, as occupier. Now this is a brilliant propaganda piece for master-class in journalism.In his much acclaimed book, On Writing, Sol Stein gives a very interesting example with two news pieces. I quote them here. The first one read- Terence McNiece, 14, was arraigned yesterday in Town Court for allegedly stealing a bicycle belonging to a neighbour.The same piece of news, when written by a smart journalist like Ms Naqvi would read as, again quoting Sol Stein, According to the testimony of her mother, Terrance McNiece wanted a bicycle more than anything in the world, but she couldn’t afford to buy one. Terence, age 14, was arraigned yesterday in Town Court for allegedly stealing a bicycle belonging to a neighbour.Sol writes- Conflict can arise from a thwarted desire, but the desire must be planted here.Does this not explain the occupier-occupied narrative that Ms Naqvi, like all closet Islamist supremacists, are peddling? What can be a bigger, loftier and nobler desire than to be free, the desire to not be occupied. Only slight overlooking of the fact is needed, like Jews lived there centuries before the advent of Islam, that the First Temple was made around ten Centuries before Christ, and almost 15 centuries before the advent of Islam.She has a problem with the Jewish writer trying to superimpose the developments in the Middle-East on India, in terms of Hindus and Muslims of India. But is that not the reason that she has written this rebuttal, she, who technically has no skin in the game, against the person who has something personal at stake here. She has written it as a Muslim and not as an Indian. And I will tell you why- because her history of Al-Aqsa Mosque does not start with Jewish King Soloman but with the fairy tale of Islam, just as her history of Kashi Vishwanath does not start with Kashi being the oldest Hindu city, but it starts with Aurangzeb when after destruction of a very Arabic-Sounding Gyaan Vapi, Muslims went to Courts claiming it is their unalienable right to wash their hands and feet over the structure which Hindus consider their religious idol.The very article which she wrote to pooh-pooh the irrational fears of Yeshahaya, as far as Hindus in India are concerned, substantiates that fear, by the way she reports the terror attack, exposes that hatred that she has. It also underscores the point the Jewish journalist has made, she wants you to be unsuspecting, lulled into a false sense of security, the way Kashmiri Hindus were in the 90s, the Lahori Hindus were in 1946, the way Bengalis of Dhaka were in 1946, till such time that these fears come real.When quoting how the article ends with – If Congress leaders can not find within them a spine, they should remember that they still have a neck.- made her cringe, one wonder if Sar Tan Se Juda slogans coming out on the streets of Bharat made her cringe as much as to write a piece on it, like ever?Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

33,"24 October, 2023 ","Bhagwa Love Trap – a figment of Islamist imagination, created merely to harass Hindu men and counter real cases of Love Jihad, claiming lives of Hindu women"," Where a Hindu boy and a Muslim girl couple are concerned, this is not a matter of masking one's identity; Hindu guys are known by their genuine names to Muslim women, unlike their Muslim counterparts in the cases of “Love jihad”. Therefore, it is evident that BLT was only created as a figment of the Islamist imagination to counter the very real cases of Love Jihad which are claiming the lives of several Hindu women on a regular basis. Love jihad is said to be a figment of the imagination of India’s ‘extreme Hindu religious organisations’. According to Indian media and a large intellectual elite, it is also regarded to be an Islamophobic conspiracy theory concocted by Hindutva ideology followers. They often dismiss it as a political ploy to polarise Hindu voters in support of the now-ruling BJP. Even a sizable portion of Hindus do not believe in the existence of Love Jihad. Despite all the outrage from both parts of society, both are often at odds when it comes to Hindu women eloping with Muslim men in huge numbers.The truth is that many Hindu cinema actors are married to Muslim men in the Indian film business. There is no controversy when renowned actors like Amir Khan, Shahrukh, Saif Ali Khan, and Kabir Khan marry Hindu women. Nawab Pataudi, Azharuddin, and Zahir Khan are all married to well-known Bollywood actresses. Indira Gandhi married Feroz Khan, and BJP leader Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi and Shahnawaz Hussain have Hindu spouses, yet no one has ever questioned it, and no one has ever termed it Love Jihad. Why? Consider following few examples: Case 1. In August 2014, national shooting champion Tara Shahdeo from Ranchi lodged an FIR citing her husband Ranjit Kumar Kohli alias Rakibul Hasan Khan in the national news headlines. Rakibul pretended to be Hindu and introduced his family as a Hindu household. Tara was exposed to his lies when Rakibul asked her to convert to Islam immediately after a marriage sermonised with Hindu tradition in a five-star hotel at Ranchi. Case 2. Sakshi, 16, was slaughtered by her purported lover on May 29 after she refused to continue their connection. Sakshi discovered that the 20-year-old man’s name was Mohammad Sahil, not Sunny. Sahil stabbed the woman numerous times before crushing her skull with a cement boulder in a gruesome murder. Images of Sahil wearing a Kalawa and Rudraksha mala had also emerged.Case 3.  In February 2023, in Haridwar, Uttarakhand’s holy city, Azhar Ahmed pretended to be Rahul in order to marry a Hindu lady, and after nine years of marriage, the victim discovered she was living with a Muslim man. The truth was revealed when she unintentionally discovered an Aadhaar Card at home. It included a picture of her spouse (Rahul), but the name given was Azhar Ahmad. Case 4.  This was December 2022 from Bihar’s Siwan area in which a Muslim guy pretended to be a Punjabi Hindu in order to snare a lady and then abandoned her to seduce another Hindu woman. The accused’s name was Kaleemulla, and he pretended to be Sameer Khanna. He converted the victim, Ratna, to Islam and changed her name to Ayesha Khatun. At the Hussain Ganj police station, a First Information Report (number 324/2022) was filed.Case 5. In July 2022, a case in which a lady, Rachna Solanki, made a police complaint against her husband, Amit Kumar Singh, who was actually Iqrar Qureshi. She discovered the truth nine years after their marriage. Iqrar had two Adhar Cards and his name was put as Amit Kumar on the wedding invitation. On June 18, 2022, the first information report (number 354/2022) was filed at the Jagdishpura police station in the Agra district of Uttar Pradesh. The pair performed Diwali puja and visited many temples together. Rachna claims to be a devout disciple of Lord Hanuman.Case 6. In June 2022, this case is from Madhya Pradesh’s Bhopal area. Here, a woman doctor alleged that the accused, Nehal Khan, disguised as a Hindu in order to ensnare and sexually abuse her and that Nehal lived with her as if she were a Hindu. He accompanied her to temples and observed all rites and holidays. It was impossible for me to believe he was Muslim. Nehal began pressuring Priya to convert to Islam.Let us discuss the common feature in all of these cases: concealing one’s true identity in order to get close to a woman (or very often, a minor). Rakibul hides his identity as being Muslim to marry Tara. To entice the Hindu girl, Iqrar Qureshi disguised himself as Amit Kumar. Sahil Ahmad impersonates Sunny in order to lure Sakshi, marry her, and then murder her when she refuses to convert to Islam. Kallimulla disguised himself as Sameer Khanna to marry Ratna, but when he changed her name to Ayesha Khatun, only she realised it was a ruse. Every day, hundreds of incidents emerge from all around the nation in which Hindu, Christian, Jain, and Sikh females are being deliberately targeted to convert to Islam by this technic. In certain cases, Muslim men who have been captured with Hindu girls by Bajrang Dal activists have admitted to receiving training and money from particular Mosques or Madrassa for suspected Love Jihad, and the incentives are remitted while keeping the girl’s social and financial level in mind.This disguise as Hindu and concealment of Muslim identity in order to entice Hindu girls and women to marry and convert to Islam is known as “Love Jihad” and it is for real. Every day a section of the media is reporting such news of such cases of “Love Jihad.” Concealment of identity is not the only parameter, however. There are several other cases of forced conversion and violence too that have emerged, that fall under the ambit of Love Jihad. The accusation of love Jihad is not about two adults getting along after a courtship, working together, studying together, or even marrying each other where religious considerations are out in the open and anyone who insinuates otherwise is clearly trying to whitewash the criminal phenomenon. Love jihad is often referred to as a hate campaign by Indian intellectual militia. Efforts are being made to establish that it has connections with previous hate campaigns, present white nationalist conspiracy theories, Euro-American Islamophobia etc. It is, however, a well-known fact that Islamists are running this love jihad franchise as their flagship programme as organised and coordinated Jihad against Kafir women – the aims are simple – subjugation and conversion. Let us now discuss the purported “Bhagwa Love Trap” conspiracy theory by Muslim organisations in India. Since the Love Jihad module is in the public domain with the efforts of Hindu organisations such as RSS, VHP, Bajrang Dal etc., Muslim groups have started countering it with a fake narrative. Recently, Muslim scholar Shoeb Jamai accused Hindu organisations of creating Hindu boy’s clubs to seek Muslim females for marriage and conversion. They claimed to have seen a lot of Muslim women hanging out with Hindu men. They showed footage showing Burqa-clad ladies riding pillion on motorbikes with Hindu youths and attacking them, dubbed the “Bhagva Love Trap. According to a covert operation published by Opindia.com, several Islamists, who are part of the “Behen Beti Bachao” group made on social media which the Opindia reporter could sneak into, regularly share Pakistani propaganda content surrounding the “Bhagva Love Trap theory”. These include but are not limited to the inciteful and Hinduphobic videos created by a Pakistani YouTuber Ibne Kazi (screenshots of the WhatsApp chats are attached in the detailed article). The Islamist shared a leaflet, falsely claiming that 10 lakh Muslim women are being converted to Hinduism each year by the RSS as also claimed by Islamic cleric Nomani in his detailed speech. The propaganda-laden material also alleged the conversion and marriage of 800 Muslim women to Hindu men in Amaravati, Maharashtra. Based on reports and social media videos, OpIndia has compiled a total of 50 cases and posted the link on its website, where Hindu men and Muslim women were attacked by extremists under the pretext of the ‘Bhagva love trap.’ The attacks were carried out citing that a sinister plot was underway to convert Muslim women to Hinduism by luring them into a love trap – a conspiracy theory espoused by Sajjad Nomani in his multiple videos.Where a Hindu boy and a Muslim girl couple are concerned, this is not a matter of masking one’s identity; Hindu guys are known by their genuine names to Muslim women, unlike their Muslim counterparts in the cases of “Love jihad”. Therefore, it is evident that BLT was only created as a figment of the Islamist imagination to counter the very real cases of Love Jihad which are claiming the lives of several Hindu women on a regular basis.

34,"23 October, 2023 ",The Hindu continues to peddle the North-South divide based on lies peddled by Communist Party leader and JNU prof: 15th Finance Commission report and the truth," The Wire started this lie. The Business Standard picked it up. Not to be left behind, Shekhar Gupta called North India as a tax burden on South India. The Hindu has been running it ever since. Divisive politicians have been using these lies to propagate their own agenda. How many more times will The Hindu continue to publish the same lies? Just about 15 days back, The Hindu published an article on an imaginary North-South divide and we had given a detailed rebuttal to it. In the conclusion of that article, we had written that “It is tiresome to listen to their repeated lies but then it is also important to repeatedly counter their lies too.”Looks like someone at The Hindu took this conclusion seriously and wanted to test if we would really repeatedly counter their repeated lies! And so, on the exact same topic, they publish yet another tripe on October 20th.  This time, they interview two known suspects – one is a former Finance minister from the Communist party (Thomas Issac) and another is a former professor from JNU (Balveer Arora). Thomas Issafc, who sadly was a Finance Minister once, opens his argument with an outright lie – that there are only two criteria defined by the Finance Commission on how to devolve funds to the States. We have repeatedly busted this lie but there just seems to be no end to the freedom that The Hindu and their ilk provide to these serial liars. The 15th Finance Commission has the following 6 criteria on which it decides how best to devolve the funds to the states in India. Income Distance and Population from the 2011 census are just 2 of those criteria. States that have done well on Forest and Ecology, Demographic performance and Tax Effort actually get rewarded better by the 15th Finance Commission – which is basically the key demand of these folks! It is intriguing to see this ilk assume that the people of this country will not have access to such basic information, and therefore they can simply publish lies and get away with it. The opening argument of the other interviewee, Balveer Aurora, is even more hilarious. In his infinite wisdom, he says – “if the population basis is being shifted from 1971 to a new figure, the weightage of the population can be adjusted. It is not written in stone that it has to remain the same”. Guess what – the weightage to the population in the 13th FC report was 25%. That report used the 1971 census as a reference (Yes, even for the period 2010 to 2015, we used the 1971 census as a reference!). The weightage to the population in the 15th FC report was 15%. That report used the 2011 census as a reference (Finally, the much-needed correction was made). So, when the population basis was shifted from 1971 to 2011, the weightage given only to the population had already been adjusted from 25% to 15%. How does the former Professor from a reputed university like JNU miss such basic information before making such banal arguments? After years of providing a platform for such hate mongers, The Hindu decides for the first time that they will ask a factual question on this subject – and hence pose the question to Thomas Issac:Thomas Issac goes on a verbal tirade that doesn’t answer the question. He continues to claim that “Kerala, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu” are at a loss. This argument that states are at a “loss” has been made by politicians from other states too. KCR’s son, KTR, for example, claims that while Telangana paid 3.68 lakh crores to the central government, it only got back 1.68 lakh crores in return. He went to the extent of calling everyone who countered this fallacious argument “ignoramuses”. This set me thinking. In this particular example, the INR 3.68 lakh crores is the amount that people of India, specifically residing in Telangana, have paid as Tax directly to the Government of India. From this amount, a total of 1.78 lakh crore rupees have been transferred to the Government of Telangana, by the Government of India. KTR makes it sound like 3.68 lakh crores is the tax paid by the government of Telangana to the government of India. Thomas Issac also sounds similar in his arguments.Let’s for a moment just buy this argument. If Telangana paid 3.68 lakh crores to the Government of India, how come only 1.78 lakh crores have come back to the government? Because this amount does not include the 1.08 lakh crore spent directly by GoI on roads in Telangana alone. It does not include the 1.58 lakh crore spent directly by GoI on procuring Paddy and Cotton from Telangana alone. It does not include the nearly 1 lakh crore spent on Infrastructure such as railways, power, energy, irrigation etc for Telangana alone. It does not include thousands of crores spent on welfare scheme beneficiaries in Telangana alone. A rough calculation pegs this amount to about 8.3 lakh crores! Am sure such similar numbers exist for Kerala too. The reason so many numbers for Telangana are known is that Union Minister G. Kishan Reddy released a detailed 320 slide presentation with all these numbers to counter the baseless arguments of KCR and his family. The moot point is that these divisive politicians and media are framing the debate in terms of a balance sheet of money alone. And in the garb of making an argument, they are simply falling back on the same lies again and again. The Hindu has been at the forefront of spreading these lies. Pompous editorials and Op-Eds questioning even the “constitutional propriety” of the 15th FC began back in 2018. In fact, this particular article even made the argument that the terms of reference for the 15th Finance Commission could have been silent on which population census to use. The Wire started this lie. The Business Standard picked it up. Not to be left behind, Shekhar Gupta called North India a tax burden on South India. The Hindu has been running it ever since. Divisive politicians have been using these lies to propagate their own agenda. How many more times will The Hindu continue to publish the same lies? Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

35,"20 October, 2023 ","Amid the India-Canada standoff, India has, under the leadership of PM Modi, made it clear that we are no more a pushover nation"," Besides India's stern approach towards Canada, it's neutral stance over the Russia-Ukraine war and India's strong retaliation to China's Galwan misadventure, that has strongly signalled to the world that the days of India caving in to pressure from world powers are long gone by. On Friday, October 20, Canada withdrew 41 diplomats and their families from India. The move came after India gave an ultimatum for revoking the diplomatic immunity of those diplomats who stayed back post-10th of October even after being told to leave.Diplomatic ties between India and Canada nose-dived after Canada prematurely expelled an Indian diplomat on the 19th of September following baseless allegations by Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of the involvement of Indian agents in the murder of Khalistani terrorist Hardeep Singh Nijjar. India went on to promptly expel a Canadian diplomat in a tit-for-tat response to Ottawa’s expulsion of an Indian official over the case. New Delhi also suspended visa services for Canadian nationals.The chill in relations between the two countries was even evident at the G20 Leaders’ Summit in New Delhi on September 9 and 10, so much so that even local Canadian media chastised its Prime Minister for being overlooked by Indian and other foreign leaders during the G20 Summit.As the bilateral relations between Canada and India worsen, several reports suggest that Canada has been desperately trying to diffuse the diplomatic row with India. India, on its part, has made it clear that it is no longer a pushover nation and would not tolerate acts of aggression, hate, and intimidation from the rest of the world. The Western big powers like the US, Russia and the UK have also when it came to the India-Canada standoff, chosen to steer clear of strongly-worded public statements that would antagonise India, fearing diplomatic backlash from one of the fastest-growing countries in the world and regarded as a potential counterweight to an increasingly assertive China. This is why, when the Canadian Prime Minister sought the support of many countries, including the United States, the United Kingdom and Australia, to raise the issue with India he was snubbed by everyone fearing diplomatic backlash from India.The USA, which has a habit of interfering in every nation’s domestic affairs, was also compelled to toe a fine diplomatic line when it came to the India-Canada standoff. While avoiding offending Canada, one of its closest allies, it did not dare to oppose India. This is primarily because, India, in recent years, has advanced to a position where it is seen as a crucial defence partner for the United States and an essential counterweight to China.The West, including Canada, also has other major things to consider when it comes to India, including strong defence and trade ties that both sides would rather see maintained and strengthened.Another major reason why the Western nations haven’t taken sides may be that they are aware that India’s demand for parity in mutual diplomatic presence does not violate any international rules. In fact, when Canada accused India of flouting the Vienna Convention in withdrawing diplomatic immunity from 41 Canadian diplomats, India strongly responded to Canada’s statement on the withdrawal of some of its diplomats following India’s prod and said no international norm was violated seeking parity in the mutual diplomatic presence in New Delhi and Ottawa. Basically, the Canadian presence in India is much more than India’s presence in Canada. Therefore, India has asked Canada to take back the excess diplomats so that it is equal to Indian diplomats in Canada.Moreover, the West is also completely aware that India is well aware that it has the upper hand and that, if it chooses, it can turn the faucet off and hurt Canada where it hurts the most.The majority of overseas students studying in Canada are from India. According to statistics provided by the Canadian government, around 40% of the 8 lakh international students studying in Canada at the moment are from India. Indian students pay three to five times more in tuition than Canadians do at private colleges. In a sense, Indians support the entire Canadian private college ecosystem, which will disintegrate if the Indian government decides to stop the outflow. Moreover, as many as 600 Canadian companies, including Bombardier and SNC Lavalin, have a strong presence in India, while more than 30 Indian companies, such as infotech majors TCS, Infosys and Wipro have invested billions of dollars in Canada, creating thousands of jobs.The above multiple reasons might have also compelled Canada to change its rhetorics. On Tuesday, October 17, Trudeau and Foreign Minister Melanie Joly indicated that they did not want to fuel tensions with India by speaking about them publicly — a sharp contrast with the open claims against India that the prime minister made in parliament.It is, however, not just in reference to how India has been handling the India-Canada standoff but there are other recent bold decisions India has taken under the leadership of PM Modi like maintaining a neutral stance over the Russia-Ukraine war and India’s strong retaliation to China’s Galwan misadventure, that has strongly signalled to the world that India has a mind of its own and that the days of India caving in to pressure from world powers are long gone by.When Modi initially took office as Prime Minister in May 2014, nobody anticipated this three-time Chief Minister of Gujarat and outsider to Lutyens’ Delhi would become the nation’s top diplomat and steer foreign affairs like a gifted artist. But like in other areas, PM Modi took the initiative and crafted a new multi-dimensional foreign policy of multiple allegiances and issue-based allegiances, which has elevated India to the position of most sought-after partner on the international stage. After all, who could hug two arch-rivals- US President Joe Biden and Russian President Vladimir Putin with the same panache?It is difficult to think of another world leader who could tell Putin directly that this is “not the age of war,” and also persuade his foreign minister S Jaishankar to tell the arrogant West that “Europe’s problems are not the world’s problems,” while yet managing to maintain good relations with both sides.The West actually fought tooth and nail to have us on their side during the Russia-Ukraine war. India was under intense pressure from the United States to adopt a position. Despite the pressure, India resisted giving in. India remained impartial in regard to the situation between Russia and Ukraine despite pressure from the West.India’s toughness in its attitude was warmly received by the West, which was demonstrated by the fact that despite their differences, the U.S. and India have continued to have a strong collaboration in areas such as business, technology, security, and education.In June 2020, Indian and Chinese troops clashed in the Galwan Valley. The clash was the worst fighting in over four decades and resulted in severe casualties on both sides. The deaths of 20 Indian soldiers was the first time Indian Army personnel were killed on the Line of Actual Control since October 1975.China, still celebrating its victory in 1962, blatantly misjudged India’s resolve to oppose its land-grabbing strategies this time. Beijing was shocked when the Modi administration chose to protect India’s frontiers.At first, India and China had multiple rounds of discussions, both officially in Delhi and Beijing and at the level of military commanders on the LAC. However, when it became clear that China would not back down, India made the decision to establish trade limitations on Chinese investors and goods.The Indian government, led by Prime Minister Modi, authorized the Indian Army to respond to any further escalation on the front lines in a responsible manner. An example of this was the aggressive occupation of specific heights by Indian troops near the Pangong Tso on August 5, 2020, which caught China off guard.With its handling of China’s Galwan misadventure, India once again demonstrated to the world that it is no longer a nation to be taken lightly.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

36,"19 October, 2023 ",Theory of ‘Basic Structure’ and its impact on NJAC: Why a synthesized NJAC would be better than the Collegium system," The National Judicial Appointments Commission (NJAC) Act was passed in 2014 with the aim of introducing a new mechanism for appointments. However, in 2015, the Supreme Court struck down the NJAC Act, asserting that it violated the basic structure of the Constitution and upheld the primacy of the collegium system.The Constitution remains a living document that reflects the will of the people as expressed through its founding principles and values. The Constitution of India is made up of several key components that include the Preamble, Part III & Part IV of the Constitution of India. Additionally, it includes fundamental principles like democracy, secularism, socialism, and sovereignty, which guide the functioning of the Indian state. The Constitution establishes a federal parliamentary structure backed by three concrete independent yet assimilated and synergized pillars of powers separated out as the executive, legislative, and judicial branches.DISTRIBUTION OF CONSTITUTIONAL & LEGAL POWERSThe Constitution ensures the separation of powers by defining the roles, functions, and limitations of each branch. Additionally, it includes mechanisms to prevent one branch from unduly encroaching upon the powers of another. The specific allocation of powers in the Indian Constitution is a crucial feature that evolved to concretize a balance of power amongst all three domains and simultaneously ensure that one power constituent does not infringe upon the other’s sphere. The separation of powers is a fundamental feature of our Constitution that ensures the allocation of roles, responsibilities and powers to three distinct branches with inbuilt checks and balances.EXECUTIVE BRANCHThe executive branch consists of two separate sub-branches; one is administrative & the other is political executive. The administrative branch is committed to implementing and enforcing rules and regulations and protects the sanctity of the law of the land. The Political executive is represented by the President of India, the Vice President, and the Council of Ministers (headed by the Prime Minister). The executive branch is expected to run the day-to-day affairs of the government, making policy decisions, and implementing laws passed by the Legislature.LEGISLATIVE BRANCHThe legislative branch is primarily responsible for formulating laws. The legislative power is demonstrated by two houses – the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha. The Parliament of India has the power to make, amend, and repeal laws on various subjects listed in the Constitution.JUDICIAL BRANCHThe judiciary is owed with responsibility to dispense justice & also interpret the laws. It is independent of the other two branches.ARTICLE 13Article 13 primarily focuses on safeguarding fundamental rights. It states that any law whether pre- or post-Constitution which is found in conflict with or at variance with fundamental rights shall be revoked to the extent of variance. It empowers the judiciary to review laws and, if necessary, strike them down if they violate fundamental rights. Article 13 provides a protective umbrella to maintain the inviolability of fundamental rights due to any legislative or executive action. The term “law” in Article 13 includes not only statutes and legislation passed by Parliament or State Legislatures but also ordinances, regulations, orders, bylaws, rules, and other forms of delegated or subordinate legislation. Article 13(2) empowers the judiciary, especially the Supreme Court and High Courts to review the constitutionality of laws where if any law is assessed to be in violation of fundamental rights and inherent spirits, the same can be suitably declared void to the extent of inconsistency. The Court held that an amendment under Article 368 is “law” within the meaning of Article 13 of the Constitution and therefore, if an amendment “takes away or abridges” a Fundamental Right conferred by Part III, it is void. In essence, Article 13 serves as a safeguard for the fundamental rights of Indian citizens and ensures that any existing law or new legislation that violates these rights can be declared void by the judiciary, upholding the supremacy of the Constitution. Article 13 is a critical tool in ensuring that fundamental rights are not violated or undermined by any legislative or executive action. It provides a mechanism for citizens to challenge laws that infringe upon their fundamental rights in the courts.ARTICLE 368Article 368 of the Constitution of India deals with the power of Parliament to amend the Constitution. It outlines the procedures and mechanisms for amending various parts of the Indian Constitution. It grants Parliament the power to amend various provisions of the Constitution. Article 368 confers upon the Parliament of India the power to amend the Constitution. It can amend any provision of the Constitution including the provisions related to the fundamental rights of citizens. Amendments can be made by introducing a bill in either house of Parliament (Lok Sabha or Rajya Sabha). Some amendments can be passed by a simple majority of the members present and voting in each house. Certain other amendments, which are not related to the federal structure but still affect significant parts of the Constitution, require a special majority. This means they must be passed by most of the total membership of each house and by a two-thirds majority of the members present and voting. Article 368 itself contains an exception. It specifies that certain provisions of the Constitution, such as the federal structure, Parliamentary form of government etc. cannot be amended without the ratification of most state legislatures. Article 368 is crucial in understanding the process by which the Indian Constitution can be amended. The theory of Basic Structure impinges upon the ambit of amendment to any provisions of the Constitution of India.THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN ARTICLE 13 AND ARTICLE 368 CAN BE UNDERSTOOD AS FOLLOWSArticle 13 acts as a watchdog on the power of Parliament as provided under Article 368. It ensures that while Parliament has the authority to amend the Constitution, it cannot do so in a manner that violates fundamental rights. Article 13 does not make all constitutional amendments invalid. Instead, it applies specifically to amendments that violate fundamental rights. If a constitutional amendment infringes upon fundamental rights, it can be declared void to that extent, as per Article 13. The doctrine of Basic structure limits the amending power of Parliament, is a product of judicial interpretation and was established in the Keshvanand Bharati case (1973). It harmonizes the powers of Article 13 and Article 368 by allowing amendments that do not affect the basic structure of the Constitution and ensuring that fundamental rights are protected. While Article 13 and Article 368 have different purposes, they work together to maintain a balance between amending the Constitution and protecting fundamental rights. The basic structure doctrine which is a judicially evolved concept in the epoch-making Keshwa NandThe Bharti case is a key element that reconciles by setting limits on the amendment power to prevent any alteration of the core principles of the Constitution. The Basic Structure is however not defined & is left to the interpretation of Justices of the bench, every time it gets constituted.OVERSTEPPING OF ORGANSLegislature Overstepping:The legislature may sometimes pass laws that are in violation of the Constitution. In such cases, the judiciary has the authority to strike down these laws through judicial review.Executive  Overstepping:The executive can issue ordinances in exceptional circumstances when Parliament is not in session. However, if the legislature excessively uses ordinances to bypass the normal legislative process, it can be seen as overstepping its authority. The President, on the advice of the Cabinet, can declare a state of emergency under specific circumstances. However, if the executive misuses emergency powers for political gain or to suppress dissent, it can be seen as overstepping its authority.Judiciary  Overstepping:While the judiciary’s role includes interpreting the Constitution and protecting fundamental rights, excessive judicial activism, where the judiciary takes on roles that are traditionally the domain of the executive or legislature, can be seen as overstepping. It’s important to note that the allocation of powers in the Indian Constitution is designed to create a delicate balance and each branch has specific checks and balances on the others to prevent overstepping. Additionally, the concept of judicial review allows the judiciary to strike down laws and actions that violate the Constitution, serving as a vital safeguard against overreach by the legislature and executive. In practice, maintaining this balance is an ongoing challenge, and instances of overstepping can arise. However, the system relies on the vigilance of each branch, as well as public awareness and engagement, to ensure that the principles of democracy and the rule of law are upheld. In any democratic system, including India, there is always the potential for one branch of government to overstep its authority, which can lead to a disruption of the system of checks and balances. Here are some common examples of overstepping of authority by the three branches of government in India: where the judiciary is perceived to have overstepped its boundaries into the legislative and executive domains in India, has been a subject of debate. While the judiciary’s role includes interpreting the Constitution and ensuring the protection of fundamental rights, there have been instances where it has made decisions that some critics argue encroach upon the functions of the other branches of government. The term “judicial activism” is often used to describe instances where the judiciary takes an active role in shaping public policy and governance. Critics argue that at times, judicial activism has led to the judiciary overstepping its role. For instance, in the case of Vishakha v. State of Rajasthan, the Supreme Court formulated guidelines on workplace sexual harassment even before specific legislation was enacted. While this was seen as a necessary step to protect women’s rights, it raised questions about whether the judiciary was intruding into legislative territory. The judiciary has been actively involved in environmental matters, issuing directives and guidelines to address issues like air pollution, river cleaning, and industrial pollution. While this has been necessary to protect the environment and public health, critics argue that such interventions sometimes bypass the executive’s role in crafting and implementing environmental policies. made by the executive. The judiciary has been involved in decisions related to religious practices. The Sabarimala temple entry case, where the Supreme Court allowed women of all ages to enter the temple, raised questions about whether the judiciary was infringing on religious traditions and practices, a domain traditionally left to religious authorities. The judiciary has been involved in issues related to reservation policies. In some cases, it has ordered changes in reservation criteria or questioned the implementation of reservation policies, which are primarily within the legislative domain. It’s essential to recognize that these instances of perceived judicial overreach often come with differing interpretations and perspectives. Some view them as necessary interventions to protect fundamental rights and uphold the rule of law, while others argue that they encroach on the legislative and executive functions. To address concerns about judicial overreach, there have been calls for greater clarity in the separation of powers, the need for well-defined roles and responsibilities of each branch of government, and discussions on judicial reform to ensure that the judiciary respects the boundaries set by the Constitution while upholding the rights and welfare of citizens. While the judiciary’s role includes interpreting the Constitution and protecting fundamental rights, and excessive judicial activism, the judiciary takes on roles that are traditionally the domain of the executive or legislature, which can be seen as overstepping.While judicial review is a crucial aspect of the separation of powers, an overly broad interpretation of this power can lead to a perception that the judiciary is encroaching on the legislative and executive domains. It’s important to note that the separation of powers in the Indian Constitution is designed to create a delicate balance and each branch has specific checks and balances on the others to prevent overstepping. Additionally, the concept of judicial review allows the judiciary to strike down laws and actions that violate the Constitution, serving as a vital safeguard against overreach by the legislature and executive. In practice, maintaining this balance is an ongoing challenge, and instances of overstepping can arise. However, the system relies on the vigilance of each branch, as well as public awareness and engagement, to ensure that the principles of democracy and the rule of law are upheld.KESHVANAND BHARTI CASEIn the Keshvanand Bharati case, relief was sought against the Kerala government vis-à-vis two state land reform laws, which imposed restrictions on the management of religious property. Question underlying the case: Was the power of Parliament to amend the Constitution unlimited? In other words, could Parliament alter, amend, or abrogate any part of the Constitution even to the extent of taking away all fundamental rights? The Constitutional Bench in the Keshvanand Bharati case ruled by a 7-6 verdict that Parliament could amend any part of the Constitution so long as it did not alter or amend the basic structure or essential features of the Constitution. However, the court did not define the term ‘basic structure’, and only listed a few principles — federalism, secularism, democracy — as being its part. The ‘basic  structure doctrine has since been interpreted to include:BASIC STRUCTUREThe basic structure doctrine was established in Keshvanand Bharati v. State of Kerala in 1973. In this case, the Supreme Court ruled that Parliament has the power to amend the Constitution, however, cannot do so in a manner that violates or alters its basic structure. This doctrine is significant because it places limitations on the amending power of the Indian Parliament, ensuring that the core principles and values of the Constitution remain intact and unaltered. It was developed to determine the limits of the amending power of Parliament (under Article 368) and to protect certain core principles and values of the Constitution. The power of judicial review, which empowers the judiciary to measure the constitutionality of laws and actions including constitutional amendments, is a vital part of the doctrine of Basic Structure. The primary aim of the basic structure doctrine is to ensure that the fundamental principles and essential features of the Constitution, which are vital for maintaining democracy, justice, equality, and the rule of law, are not arbitrarily or substantially altered through constitutional amendments. The basic structure doctrine is a legal principle developed by the Indian judiciary, particularly by the Supreme Court of India.CHANGE INEVITABLEThe architects of the Indian Constitution granted confirmed powers to Parliament as per the needs and demands of “We the People”. Article 368, which gives Parliament the power to amend the Constitution, can also be amended. The Constitution is an ever-developing index & a reflection of the collective consciousness of the citizens which embodies the spirit of the nation. The dynamism in the Constitution is integral, however, the Doctrine of Basic Structure impedes the dynamism. The impact of the past enriches it now and makes the future richer than the present.” A provision for amending the Constitution has been made to address any challenges “We the People” may face in the future as the Constitution functions since time is not static; it is always changing, just as the political, economic, and social circumstances of the people do.APPOINTMENT OF JUSTICES PRIOR TO 1993Before the introduction of the collegium system in 1993, the appointment of judges to the higher Courts in India, including the Supreme Court and High Courts, was primarily made under the provisions of Article 124 and Article 217 of the Indian Constitution. The Chief Justice of India, as the head of the judiciary, would recommend the names of candidates for appointment as judges to the President. These recommendations were often made after consultation with other senior judges, both within the Supreme Court and the concerned High Court. The President of India, bound by the advice of the Council of Ministers (the executive branch), would make the final appointments based on the recommendations received from the Chief Justice and the Executive. The executive branch played a significant role in the appointment process. The President would consider the recommendations and could seek further information or clarification if necessary. In practice, the government had a significant say in the appointment process. While the Chief Justice’s recommendations were considered, the government’s role in the final decision often led to allegations of political influence in judicial appointments. The introduction of the collegium system in 1993 marked a significant shift in the appointment process. Under the collegium system, a group of senior judges of the Supreme Court, including the Chief Justice of India, became responsible for recommending candidates for judicial appointments. This system was cited as aimed at enhancing the independence of the judiciary in the appointment process. It means that all appointments of justices up to 1993 were incorrect and subject to legislative and executive interference. It is assumed that the frailties of the appointment of justice were over with the introduction of a collegium system with necessary transparency and accountability. The question of whether all judicial appointments made before the introduction of the collegium system in 1993 were “incorrect” or subject to legislative and executive interference is a matter of perspective and legal interpretation. The introduction of the collegium system was aimed at addressing certain perceived shortcomings in the earlier appointment process and enhancing the independence of the judiciary, but it does not inherently render all prior appointments “incorrect.”ADVENT OF COLLEGIUMThe collegium system was introduced through a series of judicial pronouncements and not through a specific legislative enactment. It evolved gradually over several decades. The term “collegium” itself was coined in the 1990s. The idea of judicial consultation in the appointment of judges can be traced back to various judicial precedents. For example, in the 1977 case of S.P. Gupta v. Union of India, commonly known as the “First Judges Case,” the Supreme Court held that the Chief Justice of India (CJI) should consult with a plurality of judges to make recommendations for appointments of Justices. The significant development in the establishment of the collegium system came in the Second Judges Case, also known as the Advocates-on-Record Association v. Union of India (1993). In this case, the Supreme Court held that the CJI should make recommendations to the President in consultation with a collegium of senior judges. The court ruled that the executive’s role should be limited to appointing judges based on these recommendations. Following the Second Judges Case, the collegium system became the standard practice for judicial appointments in India. The system evolved over time, and the composition of the collegium varied, but it generally included the CJI and a group of senior judges of the Supreme Court. Several other cases and judgments in subsequent years further clarified and reaffirmed the collegium system’s role in the appointments and transfers of judges.NJACNational Judicial Appointments Commission (NJAC): The issue of judicial appointments faced significant debate and controversy, leading to attempts to change the appointment process. The National Judicial Appointments Commission (NJAC) Act was passed in 2014 with the aim of introducing a new mechanism for appointments. However, in 2015, the Supreme Court struck down the NJAC Act, asserting that it violated the basic structure of the Constitution and upheld the primacy of the collegium system. NJAC was an attempt to reform the judiciary’s appointment process and may not be seen as legislative overreach per se, the judiciary’s concerns about the potential impact on judicial independence were central to the court’s decision. This complex issue reflects the ongoing debate about the balance between the branches of government and the role of the judiciary in safeguarding the Constitution in India’s democratic system.EXISTING ARRANGEMENTIt is true that the appointment process before the judiciary evolved into the collegium system, allowing involvement and influence from the executive branch, particularly in the final decision-making stage. This sometimes led to allegations of political interference in judicial appointments. While the introduction of the collegium system was a significant step toward enhancing judicial independence in the appointment process, it does not necessarily render all appointments made before 1993 as “incorrect.” The issue of judicial appointments is complex and has evolved over time in response to various challenges and concerns. The collegium system is one of the many mechanisms designed to address these concerns, but it is not without its own set of criticisms and debates. While the judiciary plays a vital role in safeguarding the Constitution, it also has its limitations. It cannot directly enforce its decisions, relying on the executive branch to implement them. Leaving the judiciary as the sole custodian may raise questions about democratic accountability. Judges are not elected representatives, and some argue that their power should be checked by elected officials who are directly accountable to the people. The theory of separation of powers suggests that no single branch of government should have unchecked authority. While the judiciary’s independence is crucial, an appropriate balance of powers among the branches is essential for a well-functioning democracy. The power to amend the Constitution (under Article368) lies with the legislature. If the judiciary was the sole custodian, it could potentially limit the ability of the legislature to make necessary constitutional amendments. In practice, the Indian Constitution is committed to establishing a system of balance among the three branches of government: the executive, the legislature, and the judiciary. While the judiciary plays a significant role in interpreting and upholding the Constitution, it does so within the broader framework of democratic governance.Ambedkar said, “However good the Constitution is, it might turn out not to be good if the people were administering it bad however bad the Constitution is, it might do its job well if people administering it happen to be good.” “Enlightened statesmen will not always be at the helm” and “if men were angels, no government would be necessary”, we get to an axiomatic idea of checks and balances.The question of whether the judiciary alone the custodian of the Constitution of India should be is a matter of considerable debate and has been a subject of discussion in legal and political circles.JUDICIARY AS CUSTODIAN OF THE CONSTITUTIONThe judiciary is designed to be an independent branch of government, which is essential for interpreting and upholding the Constitution impartially. Its decisions are not influenced by political considerations.Judges have legal expertise and training, which makes them well-suited to interpreting and applying the Constitution’s provisions and principles accurately.The judiciary serves as a check on the actions of the executive and legislative branches to ensure that they are in conformity with the Constitution. This helps prevent potential abuse of power.The power of judicial review allows the judiciary to strike down laws and actions that violate the Constitution. This is a critical mechanism for protecting individual rights and preserving constitutional values.COUNTERVIEW OF JUDICIARY AS SINGLE CUSTODIAN OF THE CONSTITUTIONWhile the judiciary plays a vital role in safeguarding the Constitution, it also has its limitations. It cannot directly enforce its decisions, relying on the executive branch to implement them.Leaving the judiciary as the sole custodian may raise questions about democratic accountability. Judges are not elected representatives, and some argue that their power should be checked by elected officials who are directly accountable to the people.The separation of powers doctrine suggests that no single branch of government should have unchecked authority. While the judiciary’s independence is crucial, an appropriate balance of powers among the branches is essential for a well-functioning democracy.The power to amend the Constitution (under Article 368) lies with the legislature. If the judiciary were the sole custodian, it could potentially limit the ability of the legislature to make necessary constitutional amendments.The consensus in most democratic systems is that the Constitution should be a shared responsibility, with each branch of government playing a role in its protection and preservation. The exact balance between these branches can vary from one country to another, depending on the specific constitutional framework and historical context.HERE IS HOW THE APPOINTMENT PROCESS WORKED PRIOR TO THE COLLEGIUM SYSTEMBefore the introduction of the collegium system in 1993, the appointment of judges to the higher courts in India, including the Supreme Court and High Courts, was primarily made by the President of India in consultation with the Chief Justice of India. This method was based on Article 124 and Article 217 of the Indian Constitution. The CJI, SC as the head of the judiciary,would recommend the names of candidates for appointment as judges to the President. These recommendations were often made after consultation with other senior justices, both within the Supreme Court and the concerned High Court. President’s Decision: The President of India, acting on the advice of the Council of Ministers (the executive branch), would make the final appointments based on the recommendations received from the Chief Justice and the Executive.The executive branch played a significant role in the appointment process. The President would consider the recommendations and could seek further information or clarification if necessary.In practice, the government had a significant say in the appointment process. While the Chief Justice’s recommendations were taken into account, the government’s role in the final decision often led to allegations of political influence in judicial appointments.The introduction of the collegium system in 1993 affected the process of appointment of judges significantly, tilting the weight towards the judiciary. Under the collegium system, a group of senior judges of the Supreme Court, including the Chief Justice of India, became responsible for recommending candidates for judicial appointments. The system was said to be committed to ushering in the independence of the judiciary. It’s important to note that the collegium system itself has faced criticism and debate, with some arguing that it lacks transparency and accountability. The issue of judicial appointments in India has been the subject of ongoing reform discussions, and various proposals for change have been considered over the years.The question of whether all judicial appointments made before the introduction of the collegium system in 1993 were “incorrect” or subject to legislative and executive interference is a matter of perspective and legal interpretation. The introduction of the collegium system was aimed at addressing certain perceived shortcomings in the earlier appointment process and enhancing the independence of the judiciary, but it does not inherently render all prior appointments “incorrect.”It is true that the appointment process before the collegium system allowed for involvement and influence from the executive branch, particularly in the final decision-making stage. This sometimes led to allegations of political interference in judicial appointments.The introduction of the collegium system was one of several reforms aimed at improving the appointment process and reducing the potential for political interference. However, no system is without its own criticisms and challenges.Appointing judges to the higher courts is a complex and nuanced process. It involves considerations of legal expertise, integrity, experience, and the need to uphold the independence of the judiciary. Different systems and mechanisms have been used to strike the right balance between these considerations.The collegium system did not retroactively invalidate appointments made before its introduction. Judicial decisions made by judges appointed under the previous system remain valid and legally binding.The debate over judicial appointments and reforms in this area continues in India. Various proposals and discussions have taken place regarding potential improvements to the appointment process, including increasing transparency and accountability.In summary, while the introduction of the collegium system was a significant step toward enhancing judicial independence in the appointment process, it does not necessarily render all appointments made before 1993 as “incorrect.” The issue of judicial appointments is complex and has evolved over time in response to various challenges and concerns. The collegium system is one of the many mechanisms designed to address these concerns, but it is not without its own set of criticisms and debates.The collegium system for the appointment and transfer of judges in India was introduced through a series of judicial pronouncements and not through a specific legislative enactment.

The system evolved over time, and the composition of the collegium varied, but it generally included the CJI and a group of senior judges of the Supreme Court. The collegium system, as it stands today, remains the predominant method for appointing and transferring judges in the higher judiciary in India. It is based on judicial interpretations and pronouncements, making it a unique and distinctive feature of India’s legal system.The issue of judicial appointments faced significant debate and controversy, leading to attempts to change the appointment process. The National Judicial Appointments Commission (NJAC) Act was passed in 2014 with the aim of introducing a new mechanism for appointments. However, in 2015, the Supreme Court struck down the NJAC Act, asserting that it violated the basic structure of the Constitution and upheld the primacy of the collegium system. The very fact that  the NJAC  was  struck  null  &  void is  itself a  violation  of  the  basic  structure  of  theConstitution of India as it is nowhere prevalent that justice chooses justice which may lead to favoritism to family members & friends. In the absence of a strict definition of the Basic Structure of the Constitution, it is well nigh appropriate to deduce that the Judiciary overstepped & violated the Basic Structure & tenets associated with it. The provisions as enshrined in Article 124 and Article 217 of the Indian Constitution were inviolable & power & appointment could not have been concentrated within a fold by one of the organs unilaterally. If that is true, all other constitutional & sensitive appointments may be determined by concerned departments under the same pleas of keeping interference of other organs let it be executive, legislative & judiciary. Judiciary alone cannot be accorded special status as fundamentally deemed non-interfering & neutral pillar out of three pillars. While preserving the independence of the judiciary is a paramount requirement, the NJAC with assimilated & synthesized composition would have offered a better & competent option within the ambit of the Basic Structure.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

38,"30 October, 2023 ","No, Ratan Tata did not pay ₹10 crores to Rashid Khan for waving Indian flag and incurring ‘fine’ of ₹55 lakhs"," ""Please do not believe WhatsApp forwards and videos of such nature unless they come from my official platforms,"" the 85-year-old industrialist said.On Monday (30th October), Ratan Tata took to X (formerly Twitter) to clarify that he has not monetarily rewarded any cricket player for being fined by the International Cricket Council (ICC).He tweeted, “I have made no suggestions to the ICC or any cricket faculty about any cricket member regarding a fine or reward to any players. I have no connection to cricket whatsoever.”I have made no suggestions to the ICC or any cricket faculty about any cricket member regarding a fine or reward to any players.I have no connection to cricket whatsoever Please do not believe WhatsApp forwards and videos of such nature unless they come from my official…“Please do not believe WhatsApp forwards and videos of such nature unless they come from my official platforms,” the 85-year-old industrialist said.The development comes days after social media was rife with misinformation about Afghan cricketer Rashid Khan being fined to the tune of ₹55 lakhs by the ICC for waving the Indian flag.It was falsely claimed that Ratan Tata rewarded Khan with ₹10 crores for his act, which helped him pay off the fine of ₹55 lakhs. In reality, ICC has not imposed any such penalty on the Afghan cricket player.A YouTube channel by the name of ‘Global Cricket’ peddled the fake news on 25th October this year, two days after Afghanistan defeated Pakistan by 8 wickets during the ongoing 2023 World Cup. The misinformation then made it to X (formerly Twitter), where several handles amplified the fake story about Rashid Khan being fined and Ratan Tata coming to his rescueWhether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

39,"22 October, 2023 ","Rahul Gandhi spreads propaganda against Agnipath Scheme again by claiming kin of deceased Agniveer soldier will not get anything, here are the facts"," As per the Agnipath Scheme, the next of kin of Agniveer (Operator) Gawate Akshay Laxman, who died in Siachen, will receive receive ₹1.13 crore plus the Seva Nidhi amountDays after the Aam Aadmi Party tried to play politics over the death of an Agniveer soldier, now Rahul Gandhi has joined the dirty politics after the death of another Agniveer jawan recruited under the new Agnipath Scheme.On Sunday (22 October), the Indian Army’s Fire and Fury Corps informed that Agniveer (Operator) Gawate Akshay Laxman lost his life while posted at Siachen glacier. The corps posted on X, “All ranks of Fire and Fury Corps salute the supreme sacrifice of #Agniveer (Operator) Gawate Akshay Laxman, in the line of duty, in the unforgiving heights of #Siachen and offer deepest condolences to the family.”Quartered in snow silent to remain, when the bugle calls they shall rise and march againAll ranks of Fire and Fury Corps salute the supreme sacrifice of #Agniveer (Operator) Gawate Akshay Laxman, in the line of duty, in the unforgiving heights of #Siachen and offer deepest… pic.twitter.com/1Qo1izqr1UThe reason for the death has not been disclosed, but most tragedies in the glacier take place due to natural disasters like avalanches.Hours after the news of the unfortunate death of the soldier was published, Rahul Gandhi alleged that his family will not get any monetary payment, like the families of regular soldiers receive. In a tweet posted in Hindi, Rahul Gandhi wrote, “A young man was martyred for the country – no gratuity, no other military facilities during his service, and no pension to his family in martyrdom.”He further added that ‘Agniveer is a plan to insult the heroes of India’.However, the allegations of Rahul Gandhi are completely false and inaccurate, and families of Agniveer soldiers who loss their lives in the line of duty do receive emoluments. As per terms of the Agnipath scheme, the Next of Kin of an Agniveer soldier who becomes a battle casualty receives ₹48 Lakh as Non-Contributory Insurance and Ex-gratia of ₹44 Lakh.Apart from this, they also receive the amount of Seva Nidhi contributed by the Agniveer, with an equal matching contribution by the Govt, along with the interest. The Next of Kin will also receive pay for the balance tenure from the date of death, till the completion of four years, which is the term of employment under the scheme. In Gawate Akshay Laxman’s case, his family will receive over ₹13 lakh in total.Not only this, the next of kin will also be paid a contribution of ₹8 Lakh from the Armed Forces Battle Casualty Fund. Therefore, the next of kin of the deceased Agniveer soldier will receive ₹1.13 crore plus the Seva Nidhi amount, which could be around ₹3 lakh for service of one year, as opposed to Rahul Gandhi’s claim that they will receive no monetary compensation.It is notable that the Seva Nidhi contribution is 30% of the salary.Rahul Gandhi has been spreading false propaganda against the Agnipath scheme, designed to turn Indian defence forces into a younger force. He had claimed that the scheme was a brainchild of RSS, alleging that the scheme will create unemployed youths trained in guns, and will create violence in society. It is notable that Rahul Gandhi’s comments were the same as comments of PFI about the scheme, who had claimed that retired Agniveer soldiers would form groups to attack Muslims.Earlier AAP had attacked the scheme after Agniveer Amritpal Singh died in Kashmir, after he was not provided a military guard of honour during his funeral. The Indian Army had then explained that no guard of honour or military funeral was provided because Singh had died from suicide. The Army said that this is the existing policy for all soldiers, not just for Agnivereers.“Unfortunate instances of death arising out of suicide/self-inflicted injury, irrespective of the type of entry, are accorded due respect by the Armed Forces along with deep and enduring empathy with the family. Such cases, however, are not entitled to Military Funerals as per the extant Army Order of 1967, in vogue,” the Indian Army had said.Under the Agnipath scheme, Agniveer soldiers are recruited for 4 years, with 25% of them eligible to enter regular service. Soldiers who retire after four years will be opportunity to work at PSUs, government agencies, paramilitary forces, and state governments. They also receive the Sewa Nidhi corpus of ₹10.04 lakh along with interest.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

40,"21 October, 2023 ","Welfare Party of India may be an example of communist stupidity in supporting terror, but they didn’t use the Italy flag to support Palestine: Fact Check"," The flag of the Welfare Party of India has remarkable similarity with the Italian flag, as both the flags are made of vertical panels of green, white and red. However, in the party's flag, there is a yellow olive leaves symbol and the words 'Welfare Party' in the middle panelAs Israel continues its military action against Hamas in Gaza in retaliation to the horrific terror attack on Israel by Hamas, Islamists and leftists worldwide, who are traditionally anti-Israel, are protesting against Israel and in support of Hamas and Palestine. A similar protest march in support of Palestinians was taken out by the Kerala-based Welfare Party of India in Kerala on Friday, 20 October in Palakkad in Kerala.However, when the photos and videos of the protest started appearing on social media, people started mocking the Welfare Party of India, saying that it was carrying the flag of Italy instead of the flag of Palestine. In the photos, the protestors were seen carrying a large number of flags which looked like the Italian flag.HILARIOUS: The Welfare Party in Kerala, India took out a rally in favor of Palestinians, but they brought ITALIAN flags instead of the Palestinian flag. 😂 #FreeItaly https://t.co/GKRCuyYuYUAs both the flags of Italy and Palestine contain the same colours, red, green and white, people assumed that the party mistakenly picked the wrong flag for the protest. The protestors were seen carrying a large banner saying ‘Free Palestine’, apart from the flag with green, white and red vertical bands.“Socialist stupidity and Jew hatred are once again proven to be a package deal,” tweeted activist and radio talk show host Charlie Kirk.Thousands of members of the Welfare Party in Kerala, India march with Italian flags mistaking then for the Palestinian flag, while holding letters that read: “Free Palestien”Socialist stupidity and Jew hatred are once again proven to be a package deal. pic.twitter.com/YLYAB4A53SMany other X users posted similar tweets, mocking the political party for carrying the Italian flag instead of the Palestinian flag.Welfare Party of India in Kerala took out this rally in support of Palestine but with flag of Italy.

This is because they were carrying neither the Italian flag nor the Palestinian flag, they were carrying the flag of their own party.The flag of the Welfare Party of India has remarkable similarity with the Italian flag, as both the flags are made of vertical panels of green, white and red. However, there is a difference.In the Italian flag, all three panels are blank, but in the WPI flag, there are design elements in the white part in the middle. It has the olive leaves symbol in yellow and the words ‘Welfare Party’ written vertically in black inside the white panel.As the videos shared by the social media users are of low resolution, the yellow leaves symbol is mostly not visible against the white background. But parts of the words ‘Welfare Party’ in black are visible in some of the flags if the videos are observed carefully.Moreover, in other images and videos of the protest posted by the party and others, it is clearly seen that it is the party flag, not the Italian flag.In the video posted in the tweet below, which has better resolution, the yellow leaves symbol and black letters saying ‘Welfare Party’ are clearly seen in the flags carried in a pro-Palestine march by the party in Kozhikode.#Gaza_Genocide#IndiaWithPalestine: Massive rally in Kozhikode, Kerala – India by welfare party of India Kerala against #Israel's atrocities in #Palestine!Hundreds join in solidarity with #Gaza, chanting slogans like '#FreePalestine' and 'Stop #Gaza_Genocide'! pic.twitter.com/qE3ElKVkacTherefore, while the Welfare Party’s support for Palestinians is questionable given the horrific terror attack on Israel, the party didn’t make any mistake in picking the flag for the protest. People mocked them because their flag is almost similar to the Italian flag, assuming they were mistaking it for the Palestinian flag which has the same colours with the addition of a black panel.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

The Mumbai LitFest’. He is set to participate in two sessions, which are scheduled to be held on Friday (27th October) and Saturday (28th October). Hasan will share the stage with Congress MP Shashi Tharoor for an event titled ‘For the love of the Word- The Anil Dharker Session: Inauguration of Tata Literature Live! 2023 followed by in praise of the phrase.’He will participate in another session titled ‘Turn the Tide’ with ‘journalist’ Rajdeep Sardesai.

In Mumbai. https://t.co/wGFi9HpvImThe website of ‘Tata Literature Live! The Mumbai LitFest’ describes the Hinduphobic ‘journalist’ as “the British-American host of The Mehdi Hasan Show on MSNBC and Peacock.” “He is the author of the New York Times bestseller Win Every Argument: The Art of Debating, Persuading, and Public Speaking. He is a former anchor for Al Jazeera English and has written for The New York Times, The Washington Post, and The Guardian, among other publications,” it further reads.The event is sponsored by Tata Steel, Tata Motors and is powered by the likes of Godrej and Kotak. The event has been hosted in association with ‘The National Centre for the Performing Arts’ (NCPA) .Hasan is infamous for his 2009 video where he was heard equating non-Muslims with ‘cattle’ and homosexuals with ‘paedophiles.’He was heard saying, “Once we lose the moral high ground we are no different from the rest, of the non-Muslims, from the rest of those human beings who live their lives as animals, bending any rule to fulfill any desire.”It must be mentioned that Mehdi Hasan is of Indian descent but was raised in England since childhood. Although he apologised for his remarks in 2019, it becomes clear that his upbringing in a diverse, multicultural society could not rid him of his disdain for non-Muslims.Gentle reminder that Mehdi Hasan has previously characterized non-Muslims as immoral people who “live their lives like animals,” and lumped homosexuals together with pedophiles and sexual deviants in his speeches: pic.twitter.com/ZX7b71EvSJIn April 2022, the MSNBC anchor went on a tirade against PM Modi and cast aspersions on India’s secularism.“Putin. Orban. Le Pen. We talk a lot in the West about the rise of far-right authoritarians and yet we never mention India’s Narendra Modi and his BJP. I did a deep-dive into India under Modi & new warnings of an anti-Muslim genocide,” Hasan claimed.In the video, he equated Hindu Nationalism in India (a nation that was divided on religious lines) with white Supremacy in the West, which is an ideology based on race. His sinister agenda was to equate Hindutva with Anti-Semitism.Putin. Orban. Le Pen.

42,"25 October, 2023 ","Siddharth Varadarajan’s wife Nandini Sundar, ‘Adolf Hitler’ and 1900+ others sign an open letter contextualising Hamas attack against Israel, where they raped and beheaded Jews"," The letter essentially negates that the Israeli attacks are a retaliation thereby further writing off the fact that Hamas ever conducted a terrorist attack on IsraelAs Israeli military action against Hamas in Gaza continues in retaliation to the horrific terror attack by Hamas on 7 October, some 1,900 plus odd sociology “professors” have signed an open letter in solidarity with Gaza and Palestinians. The letter, a typical rant of the left, calls to “contextualise” the Hamas terror attack that killed over 1400 innocent Israelis and displaced over 2 lakh civilians in Israel.The letter is published as a Google Doc, which can be edited by people after requesting edit permission. NEW: 1,700 sociology professors sign a letter accusing Israel of ""genocide"" and arguing that Hamas terror must be ""contextualize[d]"" as a response to ""75 years of settler colonial occupation and European empire.""Our professors are seething with hatred against the West. pic.twitter.com/4lxaftaepzThe excerpt reads, “As educators, it is our duty to stand by the principles of critical inquiry and learning, to hold the university as a space for conversation that foregrounds historical truths, and that contextualises this past week’s violence in the context of 75 years of settler colonial occupation and European empire.”The letter has been signed by professors from Ivy League institutes including Harvard, Yale, Princeton, Oxford, Brown, Berkeley, and others. And when the elite progressives have it in them to speak up for the downtrodden, how can the Indian left not rise to the occasion?We've scanned the list and found Nandini Sundar, wife of American far-left propagandist, Siddarth Varadarajn is one of the signatories supporting Hamas. Also includes students from IITB, TISS, OP Jindal, Ashoka Uni, JNU, Jamia Milia Islamia, AMU, DU. https://t.co/0k1q2okbup pic.twitter.com/Mtz71dUe19Among those Indians who have signed the letter are The Wire founder Siddharth Varadarajan’s wife Nandini Sundar. The Indian signatories to the letter also include students from IIT Bombay, Tata Institute of Social Sciences (TISS), OP Jindal, Ashoka University, JNU, Jamia Milia Islamia, Aligarh Muslim University (AMU), and Delhi University (DU).However, the biggest irony in this document is that a person named Adolf Hitler, who is listed as “professor emeritus, Sociology, University of Austria”, is also a signatory. However, it seems that later the name Adolf Hitler was removed from the list. It is notable that anyone can add any name to sign the list, and it is possible that some of the names are fake. Moreover, as it is an editable document, someone is going through the signatures and removing suspicious sounding names, like Adolf Hitler. Spotted this signature. https://t.co/1u2II2bW87 pic.twitter.com/QZBU5h470dMoreover, the letter does not condemn Hamas and the carnage it unleashed on Israeli civilians on 7th October killing more than 1,400 innocent people and taking more than 200 captive. It also does not mention that Hamas is also responsible for the death of civilian Palestinians in Israeli airstrikes in Gaza, as Hamas has been preventing civilians from evacuating north Gaza despite repeated warnings by Israel. In fact, the letter just once makes the mention of Hamas violence but does so in a matter-of-factly tone as against the 300+ words of Israel bashing.The letter reads, “While claiming its actions are a justifiable response to recent Hamas violence against Israeli civilians, it has targeted the civilian Palestinian population of Gaza, while exhibiting little regard for the loss of human life.” The letter also objects to the use of ‘racist and dehumanizing language’ for Hamas terrorists, referring to Israeli defence minister Yoav Gallant using the term ‘human animals’ for Hamas terrorists/Clearly, the signatories made the conscious choice of not acknowledging the unspeakable atrocities inflicted upon Israeli civilians including women and babies. One of the appalling excerpts of the letter reads, “This latest siege comes as a continuation and escalation of the daily violence Palestinians faced for decades from Israeli colonisation…”The letter essentially negates that the Israeli attacks are a retaliation thereby further writing off the fact that Hamas ever conducted a terrorist attack on Israel. That it consciously leaves out any mention of the terrorist attack and talks about the ongoing Israel-Hamas war in the context of “75 years of settler colonial occupation” shows how this global left lobby joiin forces with Islamists to legitimise the existence of terrorist groups like Hamas.Netizens have pointed out several flaws in the letter that raise questions on the credibility of the letter and even its signatories. There is of course the Adolf Hitler bit for one. “Academic Watchdog” Steve McGuire shared an image of the document while it was still accepting entries showing how the document has several collaborators.Captured some editing. pic.twitter.com/qT7wYQ8VEcX user Abigail Anthony, a writer, also recorded a 33-second video while the document was still being edited. The name of Michael Rodriguez, an associate professor of Sociology at the University of California, appeared on the document as he deleted an entry signed by the name Jill Biden, “professor, Northern Virginia Community College”.The apparent editor of the document goes by the name Michael Rodriguez-Muniz on X, formerly Twitter, and had first shared the open letter on 18th October calling on his followers to sign and share the same.Open Letter: Sociologists in Solidarity with GazaSign on and Share!https://t.co/xPLyic4welAuthor and Professor Bradley Campbell pointed out on X that the list consists of “mostly usual suspects plus a bunch of grad students. Some of them aren’t even in sociology departments.” 1700 sounds like a lot, but go through the list and it's mostly the usual suspects plus a bunch of grad students. Some of them aren't even in sociology departments. So things are bad, but not as bad as you might think. https://t.co/mOnyo1gvuDAnother X user, Grayson Quay, pointed out that the document can be signed under whatever name one wants. “They don’t vet the signatures at all. I just signed as Reinhard Heydrich,” he wrote.Do what you will with this information, but you can just sign this under whatever name you want. They don't vet the signatures at all.I just signed as Reinhard Heydrich. https://t.co/dFMyPTI1zuThis nth letter by the global left lobby comprising of 1,700 self-proclaimed “sociologists” whose credibility is as good as a troll account on social media, shows their sheer desperation to find an excuse of a “cause” to clutch on to. The left has become irrelevant, and Islam is their only fodder for the want of a revolution. Unfortunately, the victims of terrorism continue to have to fight for justice even in death.

43,"25 October, 2023 ",Islamists claim freed Israeli hostage was treated well by Hamas but here is what she said narrating her harrowing tale at the hands of the Islamic terrorists," The Islamists who cherry-picked her statement to claim that Hamas terrorists were humanitarians, conveniently failed to mention the details of her ordeal and the torture she faced at the hands of the terrorists. On Tuesday (24th October), the Hamas terrorists released two Israeli hostages among the 220 held. The two released women have been identified as Nurit Cooper, 79, and Yochaved Lifshitz, 85. It is being said that these two were released due to their deteriorating health conditions. While some of the Islamist and left-leaning media portals lauded the terrorists for providing the women with medicines and tea during their captivity, one of the women talked to the media after being released by Hamas terrorists to reveal that she went through hell and was beaten by the terrorists. Several Islamists and media channels released videos of the women being released by the Hamas terrorists and claimed that they were being offered tea and cookies. The Islamists also referred to the Hamas terrorists who launched a brutal attack on Israel on 7th October as ‘fighters’. One of the social media users shared a video clip by BBC News media which showed the daughter of one of the women praising the terrorists. The daughter could be heard saying that the terrorists treated her mother well and gave her medicines. “Another major blow to Israel’s propaganda machine,” the Islamist user tweeted.

However, one of the released women talked to the media and said that she was assaulted and that she had to see hell on this Earth due to Hamas terrorists.🚨Hamas published a video showing the moment of the release of two female hostages – Nurit Cooper and Yochaved Lifshitz.

One can safely assume that any victim of such brutality when released from captivity, would be in shock. The victim would also feel gratitude for being released from captivity and in that moment, while still in fear by the torture inflicted, may make statements downplaying the brutality that she faced. However, for the Islamists to use that moment of fear to whitewash the crimes mounted by Jihadis only goes to show how desperate the ecosystem is to paint Hamas as good samaritans instead of the terrorists they are, given that they beheaded, raped, tortured and murdered over 1500 Jews. The Islamists who cherry-picked her statement to claim that Hamas terrorists were humanitarians, conveniently failed to mention the details of her ordeal and the torture she faced at the hands of the terrorists. While the Islamists tried to paint Hamas as good samaritans, the released woman identified as Yocheved Lifshitz, 85, said, “They beat me, laid me on a motorcycle, and rode through the fields with me towards Gaza. They brought me to the tunnels; we walked kilometres underground. They beat me in the ribs, even with sticks.” Further exposing the brutality of the Hamas terrorists, the woman said that she was abducted on a motorbike by the terrorists and her head was on one side and her body on the other when on the bike. “When I was on the bike, my head was on one side and the rest of my body on the other side. The young men hit me on the way. They didn’t break my ribs but it was painful and I had difficulty breathing,” she was quoted as saying. “I’ve been through hell … we didn’t think or know we would get to this situation,” she added. The large influential accounts who shared Hamas giving tea to the 85 years old hostages yesterday were only helping the murderous Hamas terrorists spread their propaganda. Yochaved Lifshitz, who escaped captivity by the murderers and Nazis Hamas-ISIS: ""They beat me, laid me on… pic.twitter.com/K3tiFlSwXwThe woman also stated that they were provided with only one time of meal and that barely included a cucumber and some cheese. ‘I was assaulted and beaten with sticks,” she reiterated. However, the released hostage revealed that the terrorists seemed prepared for this situation as they had everything in there that men and women needed including shampoo. “They treated us well and provided all our needs. They also ate the same food as they provided it to us,” the woman added. After being released, the woman could be seen shaking hands with the terrorists. On asking about it, she said that she did so because she was treated ‘well’ during the captivity and was provided with medicines. Notably, Lifshitz’s husband is still held hostage by the Hamas terrorists. It is important to note that the Hamas terrorists launched a brutal attack on the Jewish state on 7th October killing around 1400 Israelis and injuring several others. The terrorists raped the Israeli women, murdered and removed the body parts of the Jewish people, and also didn’t spare the elders and the children. The attack on Israel by the Hamas terrorists marks one of the most brutal attacks in history. After the attack by Hamas, Israel launched a counter-attack on Gaza last week. Ministry of Health in Gaza has reported over 5,000 Palestinians have been killed so far, including over 2,000 children and 1,100 women as well as journalists, medical workers, and first responders, with more than 15,000 injured. Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

44,"25 October, 2023 ","Congress-owned paper National Herald spreads hate against Gujaratis and Jains living in Mumbai, terms their vegetarianism as ‘food terrorism’"," This article in the Congress mouthpiece comes from the same Sujata Anandan who in her old posts on X (formerly Twitter) had attributed the glory of the courage of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj to the Mughals. On Tuesday (24th October), Sujata Anandan – the editor of the fraud-accused Congress mouthpiece National Herald – spread hate against Gujaratis and Jains living in Mumbai. In her article published in the Congress mouthpiece, she called the vegetarianism of Jains and Gujaratis in Mumbai “food terrorism”. Sharing her article on X, Sujata Anandan posted, “Go back to Gujarat if you don’t like the smell of fish and rice – Maharashtrians begin to reclaim their own state.”Go back to Gujarat if you don't like the smell of fish and rice – Maharashtrians begin to reclaim their own statehttps://t.co/UgXZMnU9q9In her article titled ‘Dietary apartheid: Mumbai gets a taste of food terrorism’, Sujata Anandan wrote, “Fish and rice are the staple of Maharashtrians and they don’t see why they should give up their diet to please later settlers, like the Gujaratis who hate even the smell of fish.”Villifying Gujaratis in her article, she described various incidents of what she called food terrorism and accused Gujaratis and Jains in Mumbai of targetting Marathis over food habits. She added, “In an incident in a Mumbai suburb, the Gujaratis were even more aggressive—they started dumping garbage at the doors of the Maharashtrian residents, even dog poop and cow dung. The majority of society in this case backed them up, completely ostracising the family and forcing the Maharashtrians out of the building.”She added, “This kind of food terrorism began in the late 1980s, when former prime minister Morarji Desai forced the shutdown of a non-vegetarian restaurant on the ground floor of his building, claiming that the odours disturbed his tranquillity.”In the guise of batting for the so-called just rights of Marathis in Mumbai, what Sujata Anandan peddled was nothing but an agenda to divide Hindus along various caste lines and regional identities. She wrote, “Social media posts by young Maharashtrians have been raging against the Shethjis and Bhatjis – Gujarati traders and priests – and calling to banish them from Mumbai and Maharashtra! Former Maharashtra minister Jitendra Awhad of the Nationalist Congress Party pointed out that the Kolis (fishermen), the Agris (who built Mumbai for the British) and the upper-crust Pathare Prabhus (who gave the city a cultural mooring) are the original inhabitants of Mumbai.”Notably, it is the same Sujata Anandan who in her old posts on X (formerly Twitter) had attributed the glory of the courage of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj to the Mughals. She had also posted that the armed forces of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj would loot and rape people. A case was filed against her in the Santa Cruz police station in Mumbai, based on the complaint filed by BJP leader Nitesh Rane. Now, to widen the social divide among Hindu communities, she has resorted to furthering the hatred against Jains, Gujaratis and other upper-caste Hindus calling their vegetarianism food terrorism. In the guise of presenting a case for non-vegetarian sections of the Marathi community, she is creating a social divide between the people of different communities living in Mumbai, by calling out particular castes and communities consuming vegetarian food as food terrorists.

45,"24 October, 2023 ","‘Did you remove diya because it was non-Islamic’: Arfa Khanum Sherwani gets slammed for tweet on Dusshera, others wonder if tweet was ‘Danish Kaneria effect’"," It is important to note that this post comes a day after former Pakistani cricketer Danish Kaneria asked The Wire ‘journalist’ Arfa Khanum Sherwani to migrate to Pakistan. He also challenged the senior editor of the leftist propaganda outlet to show any tweet that she had posted in support of Bharat and its culture.On Tuesday, the Wire ‘journalist’ Arfa Khanum Sherwani who peddles the leftist, Islamist agenda was slammed by netizens for editing a post she posted on the occasion of Dussehra. Sherwani initially tweeted wishing people ‘Happy Dussehra’ and added an emoji of a lamp (diya) which symbolizes the triumph of light over dark and good over evil. However, she later edited the post and removed the emoji of the lamp. After this, netizens slammed the journalist for editing the post and indicated that she removed the emoji may be because it was a Hindu symbol. One of the users with id @SmokingLiberals commented on the post and questioned, “Edit karke diya isiliye hataya kyunki non-islamic that? (Did you remove the diya emoji because it was non-Islamic?)” Edit karke diya isiliye hataya kyunki non-islamic tha? pic.twitter.com/HdN3Cqqo9rMeanwhile, another user also questioned the ‘journalist’ asking about what was the reason behind editing the post and removing the lamp from the original post. “Diya kyu hataya (why did you remove diya?” asked one @ShrivastavAni as he thanked former Pakistani cricketer Danish Kaneria for challenging the ‘journalist’ into praising the Indian culture the other day. Diya 🪔 kyon hataya ? Anyways thank you @DanishKaneria61 pic.twitter.com/WS0CCV2UCL“बस कर पगली …..” – @DanishKaneria61P.S. “🪔” delete kyon kiya?? pic.twitter.com/PcXkZLM7TvHowever, others indicated that this was the first time the ‘journalist’ had posted something aligned with the Hindu festival. They also indicated that this was because of Danish Kaneria who challenged the senior editor of the leftist propaganda outlet on October 23 to show any tweet that she had posted in support of Bharat and its culture.It is important to note that this post comes a day after former Pakistani cricketer Danish Kaneria asked The Wire ‘journalist’ Arfa Khanum Sherwani to migrate to Pakistan. He also challenged the senior editor of the leftist propaganda outlet to show any tweet that she had posted in support of Bharat and its culture.The saga began after Sherwani accused the Indian cricket fans of supposedly displaying ‘majoritarianism’ during the 2023 World Cup. Danish Kaneria then asked The Wire ‘journalist’ to leave India if she had issues with her Indian entity. Sherwani however accused Kaneria of posting communal trolls against her. After a series of tweet spat between the duo Kaneria then lashed out at Arfa Khanum Sherwani and said, “Let’s end the debate with a single answer – Just show me a single tweet in which you praised Bharat and its culture.” I am not taking about conversion, majoritarianism, Hindus, Indian Muslims or religion. I am simply talking about your ‘loyalty’. Got it? Let’s end the debate with single answer — “Just show me a single tweet in which you praised Bharat and its culture.” https://t.co/xtuZ06RL0KA day after this, Sherwani who probably never exchanged wishes on any Hindu festival, who believes that saying ‘Bharat Mata ki Jay’ is communal and a majoritarian slogan, wished on Dusshera tweeting, “Happy Dusshera”. While the tweet seemed to shock many of her Islamist followers, others slammed her for editing the lamp (diya) emoji from the tweet, which symbolizes the triumph of light over dark and good over evil on the Hindu festivals.

ASI officials said the new batch of 1,414 objects is likely to include non-antiquities as well, and will be ranked accordingly, keeping the definition of ""antiquity"" in mind.A batch of 1,414 antiquities is set to return to India from the United States. Reports citing government sources claim that the objects have already been given to the Consulate General of India in New York.The antiquities will include objects displayed in New York’s Metropolitan Museum of Art (Met Museum). Sources say that as per procedure, a team from the Archeological Survey of India (ASI) is being sent to the US for verification of the objects, after which the repatriation process can be initiated.USA offers back 1400 #Murtis and antiquities to Bharat. Literally the biggest restitution ever. Unimaginable before HPM @narendramodi Govt. 👏👏@kishanreddybjp @M_Lekhi 🙏#BringOurGodsHome @IndiaPrideProj https://t.co/KWSuiUSPxOThe ASI team will also authenticate the objects as “antiquities” or “non-antiquities”. ASI officials said the new batch of 1,414 objects is likely to include non-antiquities as well, and will be ranked accordingly, keeping the definition of “antiquity” in mind.No specific details regarding their age or region have been provided to the ASI at this stage. However, the US authorities have reportedly said that the 1,414 objects from different sources seem to be of “Indian provenance”.As per the Antiquities and Art Treasures Act, 1972, antiquity is defined as “any coin, sculpture, painting, epigraph or other work of art or craftsmanship; any article, object or thing detached from a building or cave; any article, object or thing illustrative of science, art, crafts, literature, religion, customs, morals or politics in bygone ages; any article, object or thing of historical interest” that “has been in existence for not less than 100 years”.Non-antiquities are generally decorative objects and idols, or replicas of original art objects used for ornamental purposes.A joint investigation by The Indian Express in March revealed that a treasure trove at the Met was traced to antique dealer Subhash Kapoor, who was serving a prison term in Tamil Nadu for smuggling antiquities.On 22nd March, the Supreme Court of the State of New York had issued a warrant against the Met giving the authorities ten days to seize the antiquities.On 30th March, the Met had issued a statement saying it would “transfer 15 sculptures for return to the Government of India, after having learned that the works were illegally removed from India”. 10 of the 15 items in the search warrant were flagged in The Indian Express report.Earlier, in July, the Indian government had said the objects from the Met were expected to arrive in the next three to six months. 105 antiquities were handed over by the US authorities to the Indian Consulate in New York on 17th July, and repatriated to India in August. The Met’s objects were not among them.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds. In name of saving democracy, they get money from various sources.

47,"19 October, 2023 ",Ram Mandir: 51-inch Balswaroop idol to be handed over to the Temple trust by 31st October," The Ram Lalla idols are being made based on the sketch of internationally acclaimed artist Vasudeo Kamath. He hails from Karnataka’s Karkala town and his paintings from the Ramayana series are acclaimed worldwide.The decades-long wait of Hindu devotees is going to end in January 2024. The construction work of the Bhavya Ram Mandir at Ram Janmabhoomi is progressing rapidly. In May, the Ram Janmabhoomi temple trust announced that three sculptors are making the Ram Lalla statue to be placed in the Garbhagriha. A member of one of the three teams, Vipin Bhadouriya recently informed that the 51-inch tall Balswaroop idol will be handed over to the Ram Janmabhoomi Temple trust by 31st October. Bhadouriya asserted, “The statue of Ramlalla, which will be placed in the sanctum sanctorum of Ayodhya’s Ram temple, is almost complete and will be handed over to the Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra Trust by 31st October.” Bhadouriya has been working around the clock with his mentor, Ganesh Bhatt, who is an eminent sculptor from Karnataka. Regarding Ramlalla’s idol, Bhadouriya noted, “Our idol made of black stone will be the world’s most beautiful statue of Lord Ram, more beautiful than what was imagined. The beauty of the idol would leave people mesmerised.” He further highlighted that the idol depicts a balswaroop Ram, as a five-year-old, standing on a lotus, carrying a bow in one hand and an arrow in the other. Additionally, the statue would also have fine carvings and designs. All signs related to Lord Ram are carved on the statue which will be 51 inches tall.Bhadouriya added, “I am happy that our efforts have yielded some good results. Our work is on the verge of completion. After some finishing touches, the idol will be handed over to the trust by the end of this month.” However, he is not the only one who is preparing the Ram Lalla idol. In May, General Secretary Champat Rai said, “The construction work of the idol of Ram Lalla has started. Dr Ganesh Bhatt from Karnataka, Satya Narayan Pandey from Jaipur, and Arun Yogiraj from Karnataka are making idols at three different places on three different stones.” #WATCH | Ayodhya, UP: The construction work of the idol of Ram Lalla has started.

It is expected that the idol… pic.twitter.com/0PBCgjXbP0According to the Trust officials, the finest Ram Lalla idol would be placed in the ‘garbhagriha’, while the remaining two would be placed in another temple. The Ram Lalla idols are being made based on the sketch of internationally acclaimed artist Vasudeo Kamath. He hails from Karnataka’s Karkala town and his paintings from the Ramayana series are acclaimed worldwide.Meanwhile, out of the three sculptors, two — Bhadouriya and his mentor Bhatt, and Arun Yogiraj from Mysore – have used ‘Krishna Shila’ (black stone) from Karnataka to carve the Ram Lalla idol. Krishna Shila is found in the vicinity of Karkala, a small town in Karnataka, approximately 60 kilometers away from Mangalore.According to the officials, the most attractive and durable sculptures are made with Krishna Shila as it is one of the finest stones used for sculpting. A trust official said, “The stone, weighing 10 tonnes, 6 feet wide, 4 feet thick, and almost one foot long, was specially brought from Nellikaru village in Karkala, almost a month ago.” Whereas the third team comprising Satya Narayan Pandey and his son Shilpi from Jaipur is carving the Ram Lalla statue from ‘A-class’ stone or marble from Makrana. Regarding the usage of Makrana marble, Officials said, “Makrana marble is used for its durability, translucency and fine grains. It is ‘weatherproof’, as it is resistant to erosion and weathering, which makes it ideal for outdoor sculptures and statues.”However, it is important to note that the trust is not using the two Shaligram stones, weighing 14 and 26 tonnes, which arrived from Nepal on 2nd January, for the construction of the Ram Lalla idol.Regarding this Champat Rai said, “The two Devshilas were gifted to us by Nepal. These stones were calcite and quartzite and were procured from the Gandaki River in the Muktinath area of the Himalayan region. However, after consulting many seers, priests, and experts, the trust decided not to use the Devshila from Nepal. It was a difficult decision to take.” The trust has not yet finalised what will be done with Devshila.Further, the Ram Janmabhoomi Trust officials also elaborated on the procedure that will be followed prior to the consecration (pran pratishtha) ceremony of the idol, in which Prime Minister Narendra Modi would take part, on 22nd January.According to the officials, a grand procession will be taken out through the streets of Ayodhya and the Ram Lalla idol will be placed on a special chariot that is under construction. The trust officials said, “The scholars from Kashi will worship River Saryu and give a holy dip to the idol amid the chants of special mantras and hymns. On the final day, the idol will be installed in the garbhagriha.”Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds. In name of saving democracy, they get money from various sources.

He had reached the Sharda Mata Mandir along with his followers on Rath Yatra from Kishkinda – the birthplace of Lord Hanuman in Karnataka.On 15th October (Sunday), the Sharad Navratri Puja was performed at the newly constructed Sharda Temple which is located in the Teetwal border region of North Kashmir’s Kupwara district, near the Line of Control (LoC).

49,"15 October, 2023 ","Navratri: Festival of women’s power whose religious, cultural, economic and scientific aspects are equally important, read the significance of Garba"," Garba is viewed as a representation of the universe and the 27 pores (9 in 3 lines) are interpreted as a depiction of the 27 constellations and each of them has 4 phases through which the number 27 X 4 = 108 is obtained.India is a wonderful country where all occasions and festivals are observed with grandeur. Diverse folk traditions are seen from different regions in this colourful country. The sophisticated and magnificent culture of affluent India is formed through the fusion of many indigenous customs. Sanatana Dharma’s core principle is that we are able to gain fresh knowledge throughout our festivities which offer a rational perspective as well and Navratri is one such event which falls on 15 October of this year. Let us tell you about Navratri’s cultural, religious and scientific significance and explain why it is known as the celebration of women’s power.Cultural and religious significance of NavratriNavratri has a special significance across the country, especially in Gujarat. The worshippers of Goddess Shakti observe a nine-day fast and play Garba during the nights. Many consider Garba as a form of entertainment which is performed for fun, however, that is not the case. Navratri has a special significance in spiritualism and is dedicated to the worship of Goddess Parashakti. It is not for enjoying and doing Garba and Dandiya only. Garba is but one method of worshipping Goddess Shakti and growing closer to her. The importance of dance has been described in the ancient Vedic tradition. There are numerous paths that lead to God and Garba is one of them. Therefore, it is first and foremost important to understand and accept that the Ras-Garba on Navratri is not just for leisure, but a vital component of our religious and cultural history.Religious history states that a demon by the name of Mahishasura once sat to perform penance for Lord Brahma. He demanded to be immortal after the latter was pleased and told him to ask for a blessing. However, he was directed to seek another one because immortality was against the law of nature. Afterwards, he requested a boon that neither a god nor a demon or a human could kill him and only a woman would be able to end his life which was granted.Mahishasura rose to power over time and eventually began waging war against the gods who fought unitedly against him but were unable to put a halt to his reign of terror after which Lord Shiv and Lord Vishnu were pleaded for assistance. However, it was not possible to defeat the demon because of the boon bestowed upon him. As a result, all of them including Lord Vishnu began to call upon Goddess Adishakti and a heavenly light that emanated from their bodies gave her a physical form.Mahishasura and Goddess Shakti engaged in combat despite the fact that he was destined to die at her hands. The war lasted for nine days and she defeated him on the tenth day and the festival of Navaratri came into existence ever since. Vijayadashami is commemorated after the conclusion of the auspicious nine days to mark the day the ferocious demon was eliminated. Notably, the day is also celebrated as Dussehra because Lord Ram killed demon king Ravan on the same day. Vijayadashami is an observance of the triumph of Dharma over evil.Scientific RelevanceThe scientific value of Navratri is linked to both its religious and cultural significance. The festival coincides with the intersection of two seasons which has scientific merit. There is a sandhikaal (end of one season and beginning of another) during both Navratris of the year. The body’s adjustment to speech, phlegm and bile generally goes through phases of improvement and decline during this time which affects the immune system. This is the reason that nine days are dedicated to chanting, fasting, purification of the body, cleaning, meditation, havan and other practices to prevent multiple illnesses and have a clean environment.Economic ImportanceAnother very significant aspect of Navratri is its fiscal impact. Hindu events also have a substantial economic component. The income of those who create garba and diyas (clay Lamps) begins to rise at the start of Navratri. Garba is a celebration of the festival of goddess that is participated in by all devotees and it provides employment to the people who make earthen pots and lamps.Moreover, the way people dress traditionally during Navratri is also crucial and benefits those who create the outfits. Several people find work through both little and large purchases. People who produce or sell snacks, sweets, fruits and religious items, for instance, have considerable possibilities for work during Navratri. Therefore, it is equally important to take into account the financial implications of the festival.Importance of ‘Women Power’The significance of women power outweighs the religious, cultural and monetary worth of Navratri by multiple factors. Adishakti pervades the atom and governs the whole universe. Feminity or power of women is also a component of the goddess. A person’s strength is their potential and no work is possible without shakti (power) which is of unique importance in the entire world. Hence, it is worshipped in different places in various ways. It’s recognised as power energy by science. It is known as Shakti or even divine energy in the ancient Vedic faith. According to the Rig Veda, the universe in its entirety originated with a singular power and per science the universe is composed of one energy. The power of women brought prominence to the world just as the universe has emerged from the primal power. Therefore, women power is regarded as an expression of Adishakti.Navratri also serves as a celebration of female empowerment. Navratri is also considered dedicated to women power. Girls are worshipped on the day of Durgashtami and Mahanavami on the occasion of Navratri as they are considered to be the form of Goddess Durga. There is a custom of worshipping one to nine girls between the ages of 2 years to 10 years during the festival.The entire cosmos could not have been created without Goddess Durga who is nature and divinity. She is oxygen and completes Lord Shiva. Shiva and Shakti come together to form Ardhanarishvar (lord who is half feminine). Since Navratri is dedicated to women power and respects them. The fast and Durga Puja would be futile if one offends his mother, sister, wife, daughter or another female during this festival. Hence, Navratri imparts the essential message of honouring all women.Significance of GarbaThe word Garba is derived from the Sanskrit word ‘Garbhdeep’. The popularity of playing garba among young people has elevated significantly in recent times. The popularity of playing garba among young people has elevated tremendously in recent times. If we look at the intriguing background of this well-known and fascinating folk dance, we discover that doing Garba was formerly only a tradition in Rajasthan and Gujarat (notably Saurashtra and Kutch). However, it gained popularity and spread to other parts of India. Now, people take part in Garba all around the country. Garba programs are organised in temples and houses. Nine holes are punched into Garba and it is placed in the centre and everyone plays Raas-Garba around it. Nowadays, large Garba festivals are hosted by various organisations in which people participate.The holes represent the shape of the human body while the lamp therein symbolises the flame form of the soul. The former indicates the nine doors of the human body which include the two eyes, two ears, two noses (nostrils), mouth, anus and genitalia. A person’s soul exits their body through any of these openings when they die. A lamp is continuously lit for nine days with the conviction that the self-flame is perpetually ignited.Apart from this, 27 holes are made in Garba in many places, however, the mystery of it is unknown. Garba is viewed as a representation of the universe and the 27 pores (9 in 3 lines) are interpreted as a depiction of the 27 constellations and each of them has 4 phases through which the number 27 X 4 = 108 is obtained. Therefore, it is believed that rotating the Garbi 108 times by placing the Garba in the middle is equal to the virtue of circumambulating the universe.Method and tradition of worshipNine forms of Goddess Durga are worshipped during Navratri. Each day is dedicated to the worship of a different form. The nine manifestations of the goddess are Shailputri, Brahmacharini, Chandraghanta, Kushmanda, Skanda Mata, Katyayani, Kalratri, Maha Gauri and Siddhidatri. Goddess Durga along with her family, based on religious beliefs, rode her Vahan (carrier/vehicle) from Kailash to Earth on the first day of Navratri. It is crucial to invoke the goddess during the Navratri fast. Invocation means inviting the deity into the house for a specific goal or accomplishment. The installation of the Kumbhasthapana or Kalash comes first in the procedure of worshipping Goddess Shakti. It must be installed if one fast for nine days during Navratri and should do the same even on the first or the day of Ashtami. According to the Devi Purana, it is very important to establish a Kalash in the house before worshipping Goddess Bhagavati. It is erected during worship as an image of the goddess’s strength and as a site of pilgrimage. The Kalash is viewed as a representation of wealth, joy and elegance. Lord Brahma, Lord Vishnu, Lord Shiva and the heavenly mother force all reside in it.The worship of Goddess Shakti can take place in multiple ways and there are numerous methods to do it which comprise yajna-yagya (ritual done in front of a sacred fire), havan (sacred purification ritual), vrat (fast), japa (meditative repetition of a mantra or a divine name), tapa (asceticism, spiritual discipline) and dhyana (meditation) among other things are performed. Chandipath, BhavanyaShtakam and Shakradaya Stuti have a very special significance in Navratri. Yajna is carried out during Navratri at any divine religious place. It is a method in the Vedic tradition that displays a profound mysticism and the culmination of spiritual power.Note: Read the report in Gujarati here.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

50,"31 October, 2023 ","Violence in Jalna, Beed, Pune over Maratha reservation: Manoj Jarange Patil ends strike after Maha govt files curative petition in SC. All you need to know"," This is a day after the violent protesters burned the houses of 2 MLAs in Beed district. Residential properties of 2 NCP MLAs, Prakash Solanke (Ajit Pawar faction) and Sandeep Kshirsagar (Sharad Pawar faction) were set ablaze by the violent protesters in Maharashtra's Beed. The contentious issue of Maratha reservations has once again taken the central stage in Maharashtra politics as Lok Sabha and Assembly elections draw near. The long-going Maratha reservation demands in the state of Maharashtra took a violent turn on Tuesday (31st October) after the protesters demanding reservation in government jobs and educational institutions stirred violence in the city of Pune, Maharashtra. They raised the slogans of ‘Ek Maratha, Lakh Maratha’ and caused damage to the vehicles and public properties in the city. The protesters also blocked the Pune-Bangalore highway, the video of which has been going viral over the internet. #Pune #MarathaReservationVisual from #Pune #Bangalore highway, Maratha protestors have stalled the traffic movement demanding reservation for their community. pic.twitter.com/UB3PeBmYxTThis is a day after the violent protesters burned the houses of 2 MLAs in Beed district. Residential properties of 2 NCP MLAs, Prakash Solanke (Ajit Pawar faction) and Sandeep Kshirsagar (Sharad Pawar faction) were set ablaze by the violent protesters in Maharashtra’s Beed. The agitators also vandalised public properties after which prohibitory orders under Section 144 of the Code Of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) were imposed in the area. Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) MLA Prakash Solanke commented on the matter on Monday (30th October) and said that he and his family members were inside the house when the agitators burned his property. The Police have arrested 49 people from Beed in connection with engaging in the violence. Section 144 has also been imposed in the city.

Fortunately, none of my family members or staff were injured. We are all safe, but there is a huge loss of property due to the fire,” he was quoted as saying. On the other hand, the protesters also set ablaze the home of MLA Sandeep Kshirsagar (Sharad Pawar faction) in Beed. Several vehicles parked below his bungalow were also set on fire. The incident is said to have happened in the afternoon on 30th October. MLA Kshirsagar’s house was destroyed after NCP MLA Solanke’s home was set on fire. However, property belonging to MLA Solanke was destroyed after his previous comments against the Maratha reservation and quota activist Manoj Jarange Patil. Offices of former NCP MLA and minister Jaydutt Kshirsagar were also set on fire.#WATCH | Maharashtra | Maratha reservation agitators set fire to the NCP office in Beed City earlier this evening. Later they also set residences of NCP MLA Sandeep Kshirsagar and state's former minister Jay Kshirsagar on fire. Details awaited. pic.twitter.com/TcXSTsyuWmThe Maratha reservation issue was allegedly referred to as a kid’s game by the NCP MLA Solanke. He had also ‘ridiculed’ Patil by saying, “A person, who has not even contested a gram panchayat election, has become a smart person today.” This happened to irk the reservation protesters who turned violent on Monday and used fire as a brutal weapon. Maratha reservation activist Manoj Jarange Patil has been on fast for the past several days and has refused to conduct talks with the government. He has turned down requests by the government for talks. However, after the incident that happened in Beed yesterday, he said that he would discontinue the fast if the violence continued. While talking to the media, he also said that the protests were taking a different turn leading to violence. Meanwhile, as elections draw closer, the reservation issue in the state seems to have been fanned up. State leaders and opposition are racing to see Manoj Jarange Patil in person even though there is a high-level investigation underway to determine who is at fault for the recent wave of aggressiveness that resulted in violence in the Beed and Jalna districts. The opposition is pressuring the CM Shinde-led government to resolve the long-going issue of the Maratha reservation.

In September, similar violence was reported in the Jalna district of Maharashtra where the protesters targeted government buses and private vehicles leaving 40 police personnel and some civilians injured. The violence happened after Manoj Jarange Patil initiated a hunger strike in Jalna’s Antarwali Sarathi village. On August 29, Patil started a hunger strike in Antarwali Sarati village to demand an OBC quota for Marathas. Chief Minister Eknath Shinde gave him assurances, and on September 14, the strike was called off.As per the official, the trouble began on the third day of the said strike when the police attempted to shift Patil to a hospital on doctors’ advice. According to authorities, some people targeted private cars and state transportation buses. The police then dispersed the crowd in Antarwali Sarathi village, which is around 75 kilometers from Sambhaji Nagar, on the Dhule-Solapur road by using a baton charge and firing tear gas shells.Up to 40 police officers suffered injuries in the incident, including Jalna Superintendent of Police (SP) Tushar Doshi. More than 360 persons were booked under various sections of the Indian Penal Code, according to the police, and 16 of them were identified as having actively contributed to the violence.Notably, in May 2021, the Supreme Court overturned the state government’s reservation of jobs and education for the Maratha community, citing, among other things, the 50% cap on total reservations. Here is all the basic history, the current scenario, and all that you need to know about the Maratha reservation issue. The Marathas, a caste that includes, among others, landlords and peasants, make up approximately 33 percent of the state’s population. Although most Marathas speak Marathi, not everyone who speaks Marathi is a member of the Maratha community.Almost one-third of the state’s population is members of this politically powerful community. They have a reputation for being a ‘warrior’ caste with enormous land holdings. Twelve of the twenty chief ministers of Maharashtra state since its creation in 1960 including the current CM Eknath Shinde have appeared from the Maratha community.Even though the middle-class and lower-middle-class Marathas have become less prosperous over time due to land partition and agricultural issues, the community continues to contribute significantly to the rural economy. There has been a decades-long push for Maratha reservations. The latest push for OBC inclusion, however, appears to be a complicated one. The first protest seeking reservation for the Maratha community was led by Annasaheb Patil, the leader of the Mathadi Labour Union over 32 years ago. Since 1981, this reservation issue has sparked widespread demonstrations and has remained a crucial component of state politics.Unfortunately, Maharashtra, a state where Marathas have historically held political sway, has been unable to resolve this complex issue for the past several decades.Prior to the 2014 Assembly elections, the state government, led by Prithviraj Chavan at the time, introduced an ordinance granting Marathas a 16 percent reservation in government employment and education. It was based on the suggestions made by the Narayan Rane Committee at that moment in time.The Congress-NCP association, which ruled the state from 1999 to 2014, was overthrown in 2014, and Devendra Fadnavis’s government (BJP-Shiv Sena partnership) took over. August 2016, barely two years later, the state was hit hard by the Kopardi rape and murder of a fifteen-year-old girl who belonged to the Maratha community. The discontent among Marathas then resulted in organized demonstrations throughout the state, spearheaded by the Sakal Maratha Samaj and Maratha Kranti Morcha.However, in 2017–18, the protests turned violent. After that, the Fadnavis government took decisive action to address the complex problem. In November 2018, the government approved Marathas’ reservation under the Socially and Educationally Backward Class Act, an unusual provision based on the conclusions of the Backward Class Commission led by M G Gaikwad. By this, the BJP gained an electoral advantage over the then-rival Congress-NCP on account of the reservation.In an effort to strengthen its support among Marathas, the BJP also looked into reservation issues while MVA was in power (2019–2022). It paid off, as the BJP won the most votes in the local body elections. But opponents using Maratha quota politics are once again targeting Deputy Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis, who oversees the critically important home department today. Under the Socially and Educationally Backward Classes (SEBC) Act, 2018, the Bombay High Court affirmed in June 2019 the Maratha quota’s constitutional validity. While the High Court held that the state’s sixteen percent quota was not “justifiable,” it was lowered to thirteen percent in government employment and twelve percent in education, in accordance with the Maharashtra State Backward Class Commission’s recommendation.On the other hand, the HC stated that the reservation cap shouldn’t go above 50%. This restriction, however, may be exceeded in extreme and exceptional circumstances. It stated that this would depend on the availability of quantitative, current data demonstrating backwardness and inadequate representation, without compromising administrative efficiency.The 11-member Maharashtra State Backward Class Commission (MSBCC), led by Justice G M Gaikwad (retd.), was largely relied upon by the court for its conclusions. About 45,000 families from two villages in each of the 355 talukas where the Maratha population is greater than 50% were surveyed by the commission.According to the report turned in on November 15, 2018, the Maratha group lags behind in terms of social, economic, and educational advancement. The HC expressed satisfaction with the facts and noted that the commission had proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the Maratha group was socially, economically, and educationally behind. Additionally, it demonstrated that the Maratha minority was underrepresented in state government jobs.A five-judge Supreme Court Constitution bench led by Justice Ashok Bhushan overturned the Maharashtra law’s reservation provisions for the Maratha community in May 2021, citing the 50% ceiling established by the court in its 1992 Indra Sawhney (Mandal) ruling.Following the Supreme Court’s November 2022 decision upholding the 10% quota for the Economically Weaker Sections, the state administration clarified that economically disadvantaged community members would continue to get benefits under the EWS quota until the Maratha reservation issue was settled.After the SC denied the state government’s review plea in April of this year, the state government announced that it would file a curative petition. Additionally, the administration had announced the formation of a new, specialized body to conduct a thorough assessment of the community’s “backwardness.”The Congress, NCP, Sharad Pawar section, and Shiv Sena (UBT) are now pressuring the government led by Chief Minister Eknath Shinde to resolve the matter of the Maratha reservation in the state. They are pressuring CM Shinde and Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar to take action in favor of the community as the duo who belong to the community, are currently in power.After the violence in several districts, notably, Chief Minister Eknath Shinde announced on Monday (30th October) that the government has constituted an advisory group to look into the Maratha reservation issue. The body will be led by a number of former judges.“We have formed an advisory board on the subject of Maratha reservation under the leadership of retired Justice Bhosle, retired Justice Gaikwad, and retired Justice Shinde. This advisory board will give suggestions to the government on the matter of the Maratha reservation case in the Supreme Court. Along with this, we will also collect empirical data with the help of the Backward Classes Commission in the entire state. So that we can tell the Supreme Court in the curative petition that is pending how backward the Maratha community is,” CM Shinde was quoted as saying. For the sake of the Maratha community, the Maharashtra government declared it would grant Kunbi caste certificates to those Marathas from Marathwada who had documents from the Nizam rule attesting to their status as Kunbis. As of today (October 31), the Maharashtra Revenue Department has started to issue Kunbi certificates to Maratha community members who possess legitimate documentation.The state’s Kunbi community is classified as OBC given that they work in occupations connected to agriculture. If Marathas were granted Kunbi caste certificates, they would become recognized as members of the Kunbi community, receive OBC status, and be eligible for the reservations granted to OBCs.However, the other OBC groups are against Marathas being classified as OBCs for reservation privileges. OBCs make up 52 percent of the state’s population and are divided into 382 castes, whereas Marathas make up 32 percent.Chief Minister Eknath Shinde on Tuesday (31st October) assured activist Manoj Jarange Patil that a concrete decision would be taken in the cabinet meeting regarding the Maratha reservations. He said that the matter regarding giving Kunbi certificates to the Maratha community will also be discussed. CM Shinde also said that the government has filed a curative petition in the Supreme Court. Following a fruitful conversation with Chief Minister Shinde, Manoj Jarange Patil, who was on a hunger strike until his death in order to demand reservations for the Maratha community, ended the fast and consumed water. “The government has filed a curative petition in the Supreme Court for Maratha reservation. Therefore, I am hopeful that the Maratha community will get the reservation soon,” Patil said. #ManojJarange शाहू महाराजांचा मान राखून दोन दिवस पाणी पिणार, पण आरक्षण मिळालं नाहीतर पुन्हा पाणी सोडणार; मनोज जरांगेंचा निर्धार #MarathaReservation https://t.co/kCKQdlO0mhThe Police are said to have arrested around 49 people from Beed for engaging in the horrific violence.

51,"30 October, 2023 ","Pro-Palestine mobilisation in Maharashtra: 2 protests in Mumbra, 200 booked, minor children made to act like dead bodies in Aurangabad"," ""This is highly condemnable. Making children act in such a horrific manner for their agenda is dangerous. NCPCR has taken cognizance of the matter and will soon issue a notice in this case,"" NCPCR's chairperson Priyank Kanoongo told OpIndia. On Sunday (29th October), hundreds of Muslims gathered in the Mumbra and Thane region of Maharashtra’s Mumbai district to extend support to Palestine amid the ongoing Israel-Hamas war. The protesters raised pro-Palestine slogans and also called to boycott the products being manufactured in Israel. According to the initial information obtained by OpIndia, the protest was called by a forum named ‘The United Milli Forum’. The members of the forum are said to have organized the protest rally against Israel under the guise of offering prayers for the Palestinians. As per the report by India Today, the organizers had asked for permission to conduct the rally but the same was denied by the Thane Police Commissionerate.

The protestors also raised slogans against Israel and called for a boycott of products emerging from Israel. The videos of the protests are going viral over the internet in which the pro-Palestine supporters could be seen gathered on the ground in the Mumbra region of Maharashtra. They could also be seen raising placards against Israel and offering prayers for Palestinians.

Earlier, similar protests were organized in the Aurangabad district and also the Thane district of Maharashtra. So, notably, this is the second protest that has been organized by Muslims in Thane in support of Palestine. The first protest was organized by the Social Democratic Party of India (SDPI) in the Mumbra area where hundreds had gathered extending support in solidarity with Palestine. However, the protests were illegally organized so the police had booked around 200 persons in the case. Police said that the protesters defied prohibitory orders in the city while staging support to Palestine.

Later the Police happened to identify 16 persons but no arrests were made. The protesters carried banners and raised slogans against Israel in the city. As per the official, they shouted slogans in support of Palestine and defied the prohibitory orders in force in the Commissionerate.Similar protests were organized by the Students Islamic Organisation which is the student wing of Jamat-e-Islami Hind on 28th October in Aurangabad city of Maharashtra. The protests were organized at the Aam Khas ground where the Islamists raised the Palestine flags and also raised slogans against Israel.A huge crowd gathered in #Aurangabad on the call of SIO @sioindia to show Solidarity with the people of palestine and stand against the apartheid State of Israel and it's allies. #28thOct @siomsz #Maharashtra#IsraelTerorrist #HamasMassacre #IsraelAttack #PalestineGenocide pic.twitter.com/up34Dyp5ArThe General Secretary of SIO, Salman Mobin Khan; National Secretary of Jamaat-e-Islami Hind, KK Suhail, and Aetesam Hami, the Zonal President of SIO South Maharashtra addressed the gathering. The gatherers meanwhile called the Israelis ‘murderers’ and prayed for the safety of the people in Gaza. The videos of these protests also went viral over the internet in which the children were used to display ‘dead bodies’. As per the videos, the children were made to act like dead bodies and were presented as kids of Gaza by the organizers. Some kids could be seen wrapped in white clothes while others were painted in red colour to depict blood stains.

The NCPCR said that children being misused by the organizers in such a horrific manner is not at all okay and that immediate action will be taken against the organizers. “This is highly condemnable. Making children act in such a horrific manner for their agenda is dangerous. NCPCR has taken cognizance of the matter and will soon issue a notice in this case,” NCPCR’s chairperson Priyank Kanoongo told OpIndia. So far, three pro-Palestine protests have been organized in the state of Maharashtra and it is said that many more such protests are scheduled to happen here in the state. OpIndia talked exclusively to BJP’s Pratik Karpe from Maharashtra to learn that a similar pro-Palestine protest was scheduled to be organized by Islamists in the Marine Drive area of Maharahtra’s Mumbai. However, the protest was not given permission as directed by Dy CM Devendra Fadnavis. “Who are these people who are issuing support to Palestine when our Prime Minister himself has stated that India stands with humanity and with Israel? These protests seem to be politically motivated and somebody is deliberately sponsoring these protests. Maybe for votes. We have seen people from other political parties supporting terrorists earlier. One NCP leader had supported terrorist Ishrat Jahan. Also, they openly supported Palestine even after Hamas launched a deadly attack on Israel.”“Dy CM Devendra Fadnavis took cognizance of such protests and restricted one such event that was scheduled to happen in Mumbai. His office proactively looked into the matter and didn’t allow the protest to happen. The one that happened in Thane and Mumbra seems to be sponsored and politically motivated,” Karpe said. It is important to note that NCP leader Jitendra Awhad on 19th October had called out BJP and PM Modi for extending support to Israel. In a tweet, he said that Israel had become a human rights violator and that it didn’t deserve to be supported. He also justified the Hamas attack on Israel by saying that “the number of casualties of Israel’s army is far less than what Palestine has suffered.” Lack of factual knowledge is the biggest syndrome of BJP supporters in India. There's a total absence of the desire to learn as well. Their campaign _l support Israel_ is the major manifestation of this imbecility without knowing the history of Israel.India has always been in…The opposition parties in India also recently targeted the BJP-led government for not taking a clear stand on the Israel-Hamas war at the United Nations. This is after India abstained from voting for the Jordanian-drafted resolution that failed to condemn the terrorist attacks by Hamas. It, however, voted in favor of a Canada-led amendment to the draft resolution on the Gaza crisis which has sought to insert a paragraph condemning the ‘terrorist attacks by Hamas. While it is understandable for opposition parties to criticize the government and its officials, politicizing critical geopolitical matters for political gain is a sheer travesty. The fact is that India has been clear on its stance on the Israel-Hamas conflict. India has condemned the terror attack launched by the Palestine-backed Hamas against Israel and emphasized its commitment to diplomacy and dialogue over violence. India has made it sufficiently clear that it will never side with terrorism.It is important to note that the Hamas terrorists launched a brutal attack on the Jewish state on 7th October killing around 1400 Israelis and injuring several others. The terrorists raped the Israeli women and also didn’t spare the elders and the children. The videos of these horrific incidents were also made viral. The attack on Israel by the Hamas terrorists marks the most brutal attack against Jews after the Holocaust.After the attack by Hamas, Israel launched a counter-attack on Gaza. Over 5,000 Palestinians have been killed so far, including women and children as well as journalists, medical workers, and first responders, with more than 15,000 injured. IDF has been asking Gazans to move away from Northern Gaza but Egypt has closed the Rafah crossing and has declared that it won’t allow any refugees from Gaza.

52,"30 October, 2023 ","Dominic Martin, who took responsibility for Kerala blast, accuses Jehova’s Witness’ of having ‘anti-national beliefs’ which incidentally match radical Islam"," Martin reportedly said that Jehova's Witnesses ask the children not to sing the national anthem or join the defence services. ""They reach that all people of the world will perish and only they will live. What should we do with the people who long for the ruin of the entire people in the world? I could not find a solution,"" Martin said.The death toll rose to three in the Kerala blasts that rocked the prayer convention of Jehova’s Witnesses in Kochi, Kerala on 29th October after a 12-year-old girl succumbed to burn injuries during treatment.The girl, a resident of Ernakulam district, had suffered 95 per cent burns and was on ventilator support. Two other women, Leona (55), and Kumari (53) are among the deceased. More than 50 people have been injured in the blasts at the Zamra International Convention and Exhibition Centre at Kalamassery.Hours after the blasts, a man named Dominic Martin surrendered to the police claiming responsibility for the explosions. Before his arrest, Martin, a former member of Jehova’s Witness, appeared live on a social media platform and said that he believed that its teachings were “anti-national and seditious”.“Their teaching is not right. They are teaching anti-national things. I told them that they should change their ways. Staying in a…but cursing and addressing people in that country in the worst…derogatory form is they do. They are telling a 4-year-old child that if somebody from another community gives you candy, you shouldn’t have it. From an early age, they are feeding such poison into the child,” the accused reportedly alleged.He further said, “I took this decision because I understood that this organisation is bad for the country. Political parties won’t take action because everyone is scared of religion. You should open your eyes.”The Indian Express quoted Martin saying that Jehova’s Witnesses ask the children not to sing the national anthem or join the defence services. “They reach that all people of the world will perish and only they will live. What should we do with the people who long for the ruin of the entire people in the world? I could not find a solution,” Martin said.Jehova’s Witnesses, according to information available on their website jw.org, “strive to adhere to the form of Christianity that Jesus taught and that is apostles practised”. They consider Jehova as the one true and Almighty God, the Creator, who is the God of Abraham, Moses, and Jesus.According to information on jw.org, Jehova’s Witnesses do not participate in nationalistic ceremonies. “Jehova’s Witnesses choose not to participate in such ceremonies because we believe that these conflict with Bible teachings. We appreciate receiving the same respect for our beliefs as we show to others who make a different choice,” the official website of Jehova’s Witnesses reads. The group claims to remain “strictly neutral” in political affairs and “avoid affiliation with other religions”. Interestingly, a lot of these beliefs bear a resemblance to Islam in more than one way primarily owing to their Abrahamic origins.Islam and Jehova’s Witness, both propagate religion above nationalism making religious identity the unifying aspect of the community and not the country. This has been reflected in some incidents pertaining to the same.In 1986, three children belonging to the Jehova’s Witness sect refused to sing the National Anthem in their school in Kerala citing their beliefs. The children – Bijoe Emmanuel, Binu, and Bindu – were expelled from the Nair Service Society High School.However, the Supreme Court later held that forcing them to sing the National Anthem was a violation of their fundamental right to religion under Article 25 of the Indian Constitution.Similarly, a Muslim cleric forbade the students of a madrasa in UP’s Maharajganj from singing the national anthem on Independence Day in 2018. In a video that went viral on social media, the cleric was heard telling the students to avoid singing the national anthem because it is not “jayaz” (permissible) in Islam.The Uttar Pradesh government derecognised the madrasa and the UP Madrasa Board released immediate orders to suspend its licence and registration.According to al-islam.org, “the Quran has explicitly rejected the basis of nationalism”. It says, “To nationalism what matters the most is loyalty and attachment to the homeland, whereas to Islam, it is God and religion. Islam wishes all nations to regard the Quran as their Book, and the Ka’aba as their Qibla, and true leaders of Islam as their leaders.”The same is reflected in historical events like India’s partition in 1947, which was based on religious grounds to form a purely “Islamic nation”. The idea of the Muslim Brotherhood, which emanated from the Middle East, and has been the foundation of several terrorist organisations in the region also is a key example.Joining the armed forces of one’s homeland is also prohibited in both religions. Jehova’s Witnesses believe that “God alone deserves our worship”. Pledging allegiance to any symbol of nationalism is prohibited. “Jehovah’s Witnesses likewise feel that saluting the flag amounts to an act of worship, or idolatry, which the Bible prohibits,” the Jehova’s Witnesses state.Last year, a 24-year-old former Muslim cleric from Kerala revealed that Indian Muslims are taught to not join the Indian Army. During a press conference, Askar Ali said, “We were taught to hate other communities and not to join the Indian army as we will have to kill our own community members which is against our religious principles.”Jehova’s Witnesses, who consider themselves of the Christian faith, are also known to indulge in conversion practices, a practice vehemently followed in Islam, too. “People may face new problems or situations that they must deal with, moving them to take an interest in the Bible’s message. So we endeavour to talk to people on more than one occasion,” a statement on the website of Jehova’s Witnesses reads.Islam too openly preaches and practices conversion, stemming from Islamic concepts like Dar-ul-Islam. Several criminal incidents have taken place with the accused often attempting to convert the victim. This includes several recurring cases of love jihad or grooming jihad.Both Islam and Jehova’s Witnesses propagate that their respective gods do not approve of any other god and by extension, any other religion.Jehova’s Witness website says, “No, all religions are not the same. The Bible contains many examples of religions that displease God. These fall into two basic categories. Category 1: Worshipping false gods. Category 2: Worshipping the true God in a way he does not approve.”In fact, one of the reasons that they do not celebrate Christmas is because they believe it is “rooted in pagan traditions and rites”.Islam too fundamentally believes that there is no other god but Allah and that those who follow any other god than Allah and any other religion than Islam are “kafirs”.“Kafirs” means those who indulge in “kufr”. According to New Age Islam, an Islamic reformist organization, “The word Kufr means to reject faith in God, God’s signs, the prophets, the Holy Scriptures and the Day of Judgment. One who does not have faith in the unity of God and does not have faith also in other sacred signs of God is a Kafir, according to the Quran. One who rejects faith in God or does not have faith in God is called a Kafir. A Kafir may also be an idolater who worships gods and goddesses. According to the Quran, they are those who have gone astray. There are about 350 verses about Kufr and Kafir.”It adds, “In the majority of the verses, Kufr is non-belief in one God and prophets of God and in Holy Scriptures. Kufr is also worship of idols and gods and goddesses other than God. In some of the verses, the word Kufr and its variations are used to mean ingratitude for the favours of God. It is natural that if someone does not recognize God or does not have faith in God, he will also not acknowledge God’s favours but will attribute the favours to his gods and goddesses.”In May 2021, a petition was filed before the Madras High Court seeking protection for Hindu processions which were dubbed as “sins” by some local Muslims in the Perambalur district in Tamil Nadu. Several such Hindu processions have come under attack by Islamists with the most recent one being in Nuh in Haryana’s Mewat where at least five Hindus were butchered and several others injured.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

53,"27 October, 2023 ",Over the moon: ISRO has had a fantastic year so far. Here are its accomplishments in 2023," Designed and developed by ISRO, SSLVs offer a ""launch-on-demand"" facility for smaller satellites weighing up to 500 kg into low Earth orbit. SSLVs have proven to be a game-changer for ISRO in the small satellite launch market.In the year 2023, the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) achieved historic milestones in the arena of space exploration. Since its inception in 1969, ISRO has so far accomplished 125 spacecraft missions, 94 launch missions, 15 student satellites and 431 foreign satellites among its numerous successful endeavours. This year alone, ISRO has successfully carried out eight successful missions including the “universal history maker” Chandrayaan-3. Whether reaching the moon’s south pole or studying the sun, ISRO is achieving its diverse space ambitions that too in budgets less than Hollywood sci-fi movies.On 10th February 2023, ISRO successfully launched its Small Satellite Launch Vehicle (SSLV)-SSLV-D2 and placed the Earth Observation Satellite-07 (EOS-07) and two co-passenger satellites — Janus-1 and AzaadiSat2 — in a 450-km circular orbit around the Earth. Designed and developed by ISRO, SSLVs offer a “launch-on-demand” facility for smaller satellites weighing up to 500 kg into low Earth orbit. SSLVs have proven to be a game-changer for ISRO in the small satellite launch market.Designed and developed by ISRO, the Earth Observation Satellite (EOS-07) weighing 153.6 kg is used in various applications such as Agriculture, Forestry & Plantation, Soil Moisture and hydrology and Flood mapping. In this mission, ISRO added two new experiments mm-Wave Humidity Sounder and Spectrum Monitoring Payload. A detailed analysis of this mission can be read here.Consolidating its position in the market of commercial satellite launch, ISRO in March this year successfully placed 36 OneWeb satellites in low earth orbit (LEO) through its Launch Vehicle Mark-3 (LVM-3) M3. Notably, this was the second time ISRO launched OneWeb’s satellites as in October 2022, ISRO successfully launched the LVM-3 M2 and placed 36 OneWeb satellites in the LEO under the OneWeb India-1 mission. Interestingly, this was LVM-3’s sixth consecutive successful flight.It is worth noting that OneWeb Ltd (now merged with Eutelsat) is a UK-based customer of NewSpace India Ltd (NSIL), ISRO’s commercial arm and a worldwide communication network powered by space that enables governments and businesses to connect to the internet. Bharti Enterprises is a significant investor in OneWeb.Notably, with the successful placement of 36 OneWeb India 2 satellites in low earth orbit, NSIL executed its contract with the UK-based company to launch 72 satellites. ISRO accomplished the target by launching 36 OneWeb satellites in December last year and another 36 in March 2023.An interesting aspect of the Indian space agency launching OneWeb satellites was that initially not ISRO but Russia’s Roscosmos was supposed to launch the 72 satellites, however, as Russia entered into a war with Ukraine, the Russian authorities demanded that it would launch OneWeb satellites only after getting an assurance that it would not be used for military purposes against them and that the UK government would sell its stake. The UK, however, refused to fulfil Russia’s demands and thus OneWeb turned to India.Sunil Bharti Mittal, Chairman of Bharti Enterprises and founder of Bharti Airtel while speaking at the recently held 7th edition of the India Mobile Congress said that satellite communication is now available in India and will serve the country and the world. With this crucial technological leap in satellite communication India will usher into the era of increased interconnectivity with satellite communication linking even the most remote places, boosting development, and revolutionising the way the country communicates.Mittal credited “ISRO’s intervention” for this momentous achievement as he said, “With your intervention, we were able to get two rockets GSLV Mk 3 from ISRO to launch 72 satellites last year.”It is notable that Launch Vehicle Mark 3 (LVM3) was formerly identified as the Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle Mark III (GSLV Mk III).In April this year, ISRO stepped closer to its ambition of having its own reusable space vehicle as the space agency conducted a successful test of RLV LEX, an autonomous winged spaceplane. The mission was carried out by ISRO in Karnataka’s Chitradurga on 2nd April 2023.According to ISRO, the autonomous landing was performed under the identical conditions as a Space Re-entry vehicle landing – high speed, unmanned, accurate landing from the same return path — as if the vehicle arrived from space. Landing characteristics such as ground relative velocity, Landing Gear sink rate, and precise body rates, as experienced by an orbital re-entry spaceship on its return course, were obtained.The RLV LEX made use of various cutting-edge technology, including precise navigation hardware and software, a pseudolite system, a Ka-band Radar Altimeter, a NavIC receiver, indigenous landing gear, aerofoil honeycomb fins, and a brake parachute system. Moreover, for the first time ever, a winged body was carried to an altitude of 4.5 km by a helicopter and released to carry out an autonomous landing on a runway.In another successfully undertaken commercial mission by NSIL, the Indian space agency launched two Singaporean satellites TeLEOS-2 and Lumelite-4 through its reliable Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) on April 22 this year. The satellites weighing 741 kg and 16 kg respectively were placed in orbit. In addition to the primary and co-passenger satellites, the PSLV-C55 TeLEOS-2 Mission also included the PSLV Orbital Experimental Module (POEM) carrying out experiments with seven payloads attached to its PS4 upper stage. Notably, this was the 57th flight of PSLV and the 16th mission using the PSLV Core Alone configuration (PSLV-CA).The core alone (CA) model of PSLV was first launched in April 2007 when ISRO successfully launched its first commercial flight placing the Italian satellite Agile into orbit. In the CA model, six strap-on boosters are not used as is the case in the standard configuration of PSLVs. Moreover, PSLV-CA is less propellant.On May 29, ISRO successfully placed the NVS-01 navigation satellite into the Geosynchronous Transfer Orbit. The NVS-01 satellite is the first in a series of second-generation satellites planned for Navigation with Indian Constellation (NavIC) services. This series of satellites is aimed at assisting and enhancing the NavIC with improved capabilities. Notably, the NVS-01 carried an indigenous atomic clock for the first time. Along with the Ranging payload, it carried Navigation payloads.#WATCH | Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO), launches its advanced navigation satellite GSLV-F12 and NVS-01 from Sriharikota.(Video: ISRO) pic.twitter.com/2ylZ8giW8UAccording to ISRO, NavIC’s key applications included terrestrial, aerial, and maritime navigation, precision agriculture, geodetic surveying, emergency services, fleet management, location-based services in mobile devices, satellite orbit determination, marine fisheries, power grids, strategic and government agencies, and Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications.On 23rd August 2023, India scripted history by demonstrating its unparalleled capability of soft-landing on the south pole of the moon. With Vikram lander touching the lunar south pole at around 6:04 PM IST, India became the first nation to achieve this spectacular feat. ISRO’s accomplishment garnered global appreciation as the Indian space agency’s achievement holds the capability to bring about significant positive changes in the lives of people across the world.Chandrayaan-3 was the follow-up mission Chandrayaan-2. It comprised of Lander and Rover configuration. Chandrayaan-3 was launched by LVM3 from Satish Dhawan Space Centre in Sriharikota. The mission’s goals included demonstrating a safe and soft landing on the lunar surface, as well as roving on the moon and conducting in-situ scientific experiments. A detailed report on what is so “special” about the lunar south pole can be read here.Making a significant discovery, the presence of sulphur in the region was “unambiguously” confirmed by the Rover’s Laser-Induced Breakdown Spectroscope (LIBS) instrument. Other elements detected in the study included aluminium, calcium, iron, chromium, titanium, manganese, silicon, and oxygen.

When the Chandrayaan-2 mission failed, India did not lose hope although it was a moment when the whole nation cried but stood rock solid with ISRO. This support and strength was demonstrated by Prime Minister Modi who embraced K Sivan, the former ISRO chief as he broke into tears following the crash landing of Chandrayaan 2 in 2019. With the success of Chandrayaan 3, India showed the world, that there is no bigger motivation than failure.In July this year, ISRO successfully launched the PSLV-C56 carrying Singapore’s DS-SAR satellite including six other satellites from SDSC SHAR in Sriharikota. Notably, the core-alone model PSLV-C56 launched a DS-SAR satellite weighing 360 kg satellite into a Near-equatorial Orbit (NEO). The Singaporean satellite was launched with the objective to support the satellite imagery requirements of various agencies within the Government of Singapore. DS-SAR included an Israel Aerospace Industries manufactured Space Aperture Radar (SAR).After Chandrayaan-3 created history by landing near the moon’s south pole, ISRO launched India’s first solar mission, Aditya-L1, from the Satish Dhawan Space Centre in Sriharikota on September 2. It has seven payloads that will undertake extensive research on the sun. Four of these seven payloads will research solar light, while the remaining three will examine plasma and magnetic field parameters in real-time.PSLV-C57/Aditya-L1 Mission:The launch of Aditya-L1 by PSLV-C57 is accomplished successfully.The vehicle has placed the satellite precisely into its intended orbit.India’s first solar observatory has begun its journey to the destination of Sun-Earth L1 point.After reaching its destination 1.5 million kilometres from Earth, Aditya-L1 would be placed in a halo orbit around Lagrange Point 1 (L1). The journey is projected to take four months to complete. Aditya-L1 would orbit the Earth facing the Sun at a distance of around 1.5 million kilometres, or 1% of the distance between the Earth and the Sun. Aditya L-1 has completed four earth-bound manoeuvres. According to ISRO, the spacecraft has escaped the sphere of Earth’s influence, on its way to the Sun-Earth Lagrange Point 1. The objectives of the mission included the study of the upper atmospheric dynamics (chromospheres and corona) of the Sun, the study of the chromospheric and coronal heating, the physics of the partially ionised plasma and the initiation of coronal mass ejections and flares. Moreover, the mission also aimed to observe the in-situ particle and plasma environment, providing data for studying particle dynamics from the Sun. OpIndia report on Aditya L-1 mission, its objectives, significance and other specifics can be read here.Moving forward relentlessly to accomplish its diverse space ambitions, ISRO is preparing for unmanned flight tests of the mission’s ‘crew escape system’. The Indian space agency recently announced that it will soon commence the unmanned flight tests for the Gaganyaan mission as the first development flight Test Vehicle (TV-D1) is in the final stages of preparation. Mission Gaganyaan:ISRO to commence unmanned flight tests for the Gaganyaan mission. Preparations for the Flight Test Vehicle Abort Mission-1 (TV-D1), which demonstrates the performance of the Crew Escape System, are underway.https://t.co/HSY0qfVDEH @indiannavy #Gaganyaan pic.twitter.com/XszSDEqs7wISRO will launch a crew of two to three members into a circular orbit 400 kilometres above Earth as part of the Gaganyaan project. The mission will take one to three days and will focus on assuring their safe return to Earth. ISRO is making India a prominent global force and making India proud with their persistent endeavours to propel India to the top of the space exploration and commercial satellite launch markets.

54,"31 October, 2023 ","France: Hijab-clad woman shouts ‘Allahu Akbar’ and threatens to blow herself up at train station in Paris, injured after police open fire "," The police sources said that as per witnesses, the woman was completely veiled and shouting ""Allahu Akbar"" while she ""made threats"" to blow herself up. The sources added that ""police fired because they feared for their safety"".On 31st October (Tuesday), French counter-terrorism police shot and seriously wounded a woman, wearing an Islamic veil, who had ‘threatened to blow herself up‘ at a busy train station in Paris, police said. The police sources said that as per witnesses, the woman was completely veiled and shouting “Allahu akbar” while she “made threats” to blow herself up. The sources added that “police fired because they feared for their safety”.“According to police, she made threats and advocated terrorism,” Daily Mail reported citing sources.According to the sources, passengers on a suburban train alerted the police after which police personnel intervened at the Bibliotheque Francois Mitterrand station which is on the south bank of Paris. After evacuating the station, the officers managed to “isolate” the woman at the train station. The office of the Paris Prosecutor stated that the woman “refused to follow police orders” and threatened “to blow herself up”. It added that a police officer then fired a single shot, inflicting a life-threatening injury to her abdomen. According to a BBC report, she is said to be critical but stable after being shot in the abdomen.However, the police sources added that no explosives or other arms were found on the woman. Consequently, the Police have launched two investigations, prosecutors said. According to them, one investigation will probe the woman’s actions, while another will investigate whether the use of a firearm by the police officials was justified. The incident comes at a time when France has been placed on the highest possible level of security alert since 13th October. Back then, a man later identified as Mohammed Moguchkov killed Dominique Bernard. As per media reports, Bernard was a literature teacher and he was killed outside the Gambetta-Carnot school in Arras. Screaming ‘Allahu Akbar’ during the attack, Moguchkov also went on to injure three other members of the teaching staff. The fatal knife attack took place on ‘Global Day of Jihad’ which was called by Hamas terrorists on the first Friday since the 7th October terror attack on Israel.  After arresting Moguchkov, French authorities initiated an anti-terrorist investigation into the case as the French government described it as an “Islamist terror attack”.Despite heightened security, French authorities had been forced, on multiple occasions, to evacuate dozens of airports, train stations, and tourist sites in recent weeks in the wake of bomb threats.Additionally, BBC pointed out that there has been a surge of anti-Semitic incidents in the Paris region in recent days. Buildings in various areas of Paris and its suburbs have been defaced with Stars of David, a symbol associated with Judaism. In the northern suburb of Saint-Ouen, these symbols were discovered on a resident’s home, prompting Mayor Karim Bouamrane to demand that the culprits responsible for the “anti-Semitic and racist” graffiti be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. On the night of 30-31 October, approximately 60 more Stars of David were spray-painted onto multiple buildings in the 14th arrondissement of Paris. Emmanuel Grégoire, deputy to Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo, confirmed that the stars would be removed, and an investigation into the matter would be initiated. Gregoire said, “Antisemitism continues to kill. We will never give up the fight.”Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

55,"31 October, 2023 ","US Presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy calls out LGBTQ+ movement, points out the staggering hypocrisy of their activism"," Vivek Ramaswamy, the Republican candidate for president of the United States exposed the contradictions in the convoluted concepts that LGBTQ activists supportOn Tuesday, 31st October, Republican candidate for president of the United States, Vivek Ramaswamy took to X to share his views about the transgender movement and the politics around gender identity, which has caused chaos in many Western countries and is currently gaining traction in India.“Gay movement: the sex you’re attracted to is hardwired at birth, even though there’s no gay gene. Trans movement: your sex is entirely fluid, even though there is a definitive sex chromosome. LGBT movement: you must believe both of those things at once, or else you’re a bigot,” Ramaswamy posted sharing his views around the hype on the pride movement. Gay movement: the sex you’re attracted to is hardwired at birth, even though there’s no gay gene.Trans movement: your sex is entirely fluid, even though there is a definitive sex chromosome.LGBT movement: you must believe both of those things at once, or else you’re a bigot.Vivek Ramaswamy, the Republican candidate for president of the United States exposed the contradictions in the convoluted concepts that LGBTQ activists support while criticising the hypocrisy of the LGBTQ rights movement. He clarified how, despite the lack of a gay gene, this movement assumes that sexual orientation is intrinsic from birth. Likewise, these LGBTQ+ advocates contend that although there is a specific sex chromosome, sex is completely fluid throughout your life.He went on to say that anybody who voices criticism of this movement is promptly suppressed and labelled a bigot.Notably, Vivek Ramaswamy has previously criticized the LGBTQ movement, which is rapidly gaining traction across the globe. In a post published in June, he called the trans community a “cult” and stated that “transgenderism is most often a mental health disorder & should be treated accordingly.” He clarified further that, contrary to what leftists think, he is not a “transphobic,” but he strongly believes these so-called LBBTQ proponents shouldn’t impose their ideas on other people.I’m an unapologetic American nationalist & my top objective as U.S. President is to revive civic pride in America.Earlier today on @ThisWeekABC, I said that as U.S. President I would not implement a categorical ban on trans people in the military (though I do support a…He echoed similar views during an appearance on NBC’s Meet The Press held in May this year. Asserting how the LGBTQ+ movement is devoid of any logic, Ramaswamy said, “Here’s my deal with this LGBTQIA+, especially the trans cult. Dress how you want, behave how you want as an adult, live your life freely, but leave our kids alone and do not demand that we change our language or the way we live our lives. We can all live peaceably that way.”“In the name of rights, what they’ve actually done is created a new culture of oppression in the opposite direction, imposing that on kids,” Ramaswamy added.The Republican candidate for president of the United States further went on to defend his belief that gender is not fluid and that there are only two genders, male and female.For the uninitiated, Vivek Ramaswamy is an Indian American billionaire campaigning for the US President. Currently, Ramaswamy stands out as the youngest major Republican presidential contender. He hails from Ohio and holds a biology degree from Harvard University and a Yale Law School diploma.In his speeches, he has taken an anti-war, anti-immigrant, anti-wokeism, and delinking Russia-China alliance stance. Ramaswamy has created a storm in US political circles. Within a short span, his popularity has swelled considerably, and is now at a joint second position in the race of Republican Presidential candidates, as revealed by recent polls. In August a new National poll revealed that he is at a tied-second spot with Florida Governor Ron DeSantis in the GOP primary contest. Both of them garnered the support of 10 per cent of the votes polled in the survey. However, both leaders are trailing significantly behind former US President Donald Trump. As per the survey, Trump has been maintaining an unassailable voter margin of 46 per cent. Recently, he gained an influential supporter in the form of Elon Musk who hailed him as a “very promising candidate.”  Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

56,"31 October, 2023 ","UK: Man lets loose live rats painted in colours of Palestinian flag inside Birmingham McDonald’s shouting ‘Free Palestine’, video goes viral "," In the video, a Palestine supporter enters Birmingham's McDonald's and empties a box containing rats, each of them painted with the colours of the Palestinian flag. Furthermore, he is wearing what appears to be a Palestinian flag on his head as he enters McDonald's. A Palestine supporter in the United Kingdom threw a box full of painted rats inside a McDonald’s allegedly because the chain supports Israel amid the ongoing war against Hamas. The shocking video clip, captioned ‘enjoy your rat burgers’, begins with a man holding onto fake number plates that read ‘PAIISTN’ and ‘Free Palestine’ as he arrives in his car. He can be seen stopping outside a McDonald’s joint in Birmingham. This Hamas-loving rat purchased mice and threw them in McDonald’s to Free Palestine.Welcome to the Palestinian cause. pic.twitter.com/UkbKSE2Im7A man throws a bunch of mice into a packed McDonald’s in London to protest against Israel.He shouts “Free Palestine” pic.twitter.com/Mzmb8AfQ0MIn the video, he is then observed with boxes containing rats, each of them painted with the colours of the Palestinian flag. Furthermore, he is wearing what appears to be a Palestinian flag on his head as he enters McDonald’s. He then proceeds forward and shows a group of young teenagers the box filled with rodents, before emptying it on the floor creating chaos and panic among the customers.  According to media reports, the pro-Palestine man also raised anti-Israel and anti-semitic slogans, “F**k Israel” along with chanting “Free f**king Palestine”.  At the end of the viral video, he can be heard giving calls to boycott McDonald’s, Starbucks, and Disney as they have allegedly supported Israel amidst ongoing war in the region.A spokesperson for McDonald’s confirmed the incident and noted that ‘a number of mice’ were released inside the restaurant. The spokesperson added that they have sanitised the area through pest control.Speaking to a British news outlet LBC, the spokesperson for McDonald’s said, “We are aware of an incident in our Birmingham Star City restaurant this evening where a number of mice were released by a member of the public. Following the removal of the mice, the restaurant has been fully sanitised and our pest control partners have been called out to conduct a full inspection.”Earlier this month, fast-food chain McDonald’s outlets in Israel faced online protests and calls to boycott it after it announced that it would provide free meals to Israeli soldiers amid the ongoing Israel-Hamas war. Media reports suggest that the pro-Palestinian man’s bizarre act of letting mice loose in Birmingham McDonald’s was linked to the chains’ alleged support for the Israeli military.Later on 18th October, Pro-Palestinian protesters reportedly attacked a McDonald’s restaurant in Istanbul. They accused the franchise was providing food to Israeli soldiers preparing to invade Gaza and favouring the Israeli side in its retaliatory actions on Gaza.  Similarly, McDonald’s branches in Turkey, Lebanon, and Egypt faced vandalism. Large supporters of Gaza demonstrated outside McDonald’s restaurants across the Muslim world, from Cairo to Malaysia. Consequently, local franchisees of McDonald’s in Turkey, Egypt, Jordan, and Lebanon distanced themselves from their branch in Israel. They asserted that they have no affiliation with the Israeli branch and it was their private decision. Some franchisees even donated to Gaza residents.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds. In name of saving democracy, they get money from various sources.

Residential properties of 2 NCP MLAs, Prakash Solanke (Ajit Pawar faction) and Sandeep Kshirsagar (Sharad Pawar faction) were set ablaze by the violent protesters in Maharashtra's Beed. The contentious issue of Maratha reservations has once again taken the central stage in Maharashtra politics as Lok Sabha and Assembly elections draw near. The long-going Maratha reservation demands in the state of Maharashtra took a violent turn on Tuesday (31st October) after the protesters demanding reservation in government jobs and educational institutions stirred violence in the city of Pune, Maharashtra. They raised the slogans of ‘Ek Maratha, Lakh Maratha’ and caused damage to the vehicles and public properties in the city. The protesters also blocked the Pune-Bangalore highway, the video of which has been going viral over the internet. #Pune #MarathaReservationVisual from #Pune #Bangalore highway, Maratha protestors have stalled the traffic movement demanding reservation for their community. pic.twitter.com/UB3PeBmYxTThis is a day after the violent protesters burned the houses of 2 MLAs in Beed district.

On the other hand, the protesters also set ablaze the home of MLA Sandeep Kshirsagar (Sharad Pawar faction) in Beed. Several vehicles parked below his bungalow were also set on fire. The incident is said to have happened in the afternoon on 30th October. MLA Kshirsagar’s house was destroyed after NCP MLA Solanke’s home was set on fire. However, property belonging to MLA Solanke was destroyed after his previous comments against the Maratha reservation and quota activist Manoj Jarange Patil. Offices of former NCP MLA and minister Jaydutt Kshirsagar were also set on fire.#WATCH | Maharashtra | Maratha reservation agitators set fire to the NCP office in Beed City earlier this evening. Later they also set residences of NCP MLA Sandeep Kshirsagar and state's former minister Jay Kshirsagar on fire.

He had also ‘ridiculed’ Patil by saying, “A person, who has not even contested a gram panchayat election, has become a smart person today.” This happened to irk the reservation protesters who turned violent on Monday and used fire as a brutal weapon. Maratha reservation activist Manoj Jarange Patil has been on fast for the past several days and has refused to conduct talks with the government. He has turned down requests by the government for talks. However, after the incident that happened in Beed yesterday, he said that he would discontinue the fast if the violence continued. While talking to the media, he also said that the protests were taking a different turn leading to violence. Meanwhile, as elections draw closer, the reservation issue in the state seems to have been fanned up. State leaders and opposition are racing to see Manoj Jarange Patil in person even though there is a high-level investigation underway to determine who is at fault for the recent wave of aggressiveness that resulted in violence in the Beed and Jalna districts. The opposition is pressuring the CM Shinde-led government to resolve the long-going issue of the Maratha reservation. ""आज एक विधायक का घर जलाया जाता है, गृह मंत्रालय क्या कर रहा है और गृह मंत्री क्या कर रहे हैं?""◆ NCP विधायक प्रकाश सोलंके के बीड आवास पर हुए हमले पर NCP(शरद पवार गुट) सांसद सुप्रिया सुले ने कहा#PrakashSolanke #MarathaReservation #Maharashtra pic.twitter.com/wBXxE0J9DLManoj Jarange Patil has been on hunger strike since Friday (27th October) and is demanding that the government consider all the Marathas as Kunbis, which is the sub-caste of Marathas so that they can be entitled to reservation benefits available for people from Other Backward Classes (OBCs). In September, similar violence was reported in the Jalna district of Maharashtra where the protesters targeted government buses and private vehicles leaving 40 police personnel and some civilians injured. The violence happened after Manoj Jarange Patil initiated a hunger strike in Jalna’s Antarwali Sarathi village. On August 29, Patil started a hunger strike in Antarwali Sarati village to demand an OBC quota for Marathas. Chief Minister Eknath Shinde gave him assurances, and on September 14, the strike was called off.As per the official, the trouble began on the third day of the said strike when the police attempted to shift Patil to a hospital on doctors’ advice. According to authorities, some people targeted private cars and state transportation buses. The police then dispersed the crowd in Antarwali Sarathi village, which is around 75 kilometers from Sambhaji Nagar, on the Dhule-Solapur road by using a baton charge and firing tear gas shells.Up to 40 police officers suffered injuries in the incident, including Jalna Superintendent of Police (SP) Tushar Doshi. More than 360 persons were booked under various sections of the Indian Penal Code, according to the police, and 16 of them were identified as having actively contributed to the violence.Notably, in May 2021, the Supreme Court overturned the state government’s reservation of jobs and education for the Maratha community, citing, among other things, the 50% cap on total reservations. Here is all the basic history, the current scenario, and all that you need to know about the Maratha reservation issue. The Marathas, a caste that includes, among others, landlords and peasants, make up approximately 33 percent of the state’s population. Although most Marathas speak Marathi, not everyone who speaks Marathi is a member of the Maratha community.Almost one-third of the state’s population is members of this politically powerful community. They have a reputation for being a ‘warrior’ caste with enormous land holdings. Twelve of the twenty chief ministers of Maharashtra state since its creation in 1960 including the current CM Eknath Shinde have appeared from the Maratha community.Even though the middle-class and lower-middle-class Marathas have become less prosperous over time due to land partition and agricultural issues, the community continues to contribute significantly to the rural economy. There has been a decades-long push for Maratha reservations. The latest push for OBC inclusion, however, appears to be a complicated one. The first protest seeking reservation for the Maratha community was led by Annasaheb Patil, the leader of the Mathadi Labour Union over 32 years ago. Since 1981, this reservation issue has sparked widespread demonstrations and has remained a crucial component of state politics.Unfortunately, Maharashtra, a state where Marathas have historically held political sway, has been unable to resolve this complex issue for the past several decades.Prior to the 2014 Assembly elections, the state government, led by Prithviraj Chavan at the time, introduced an ordinance granting Marathas a 16 percent reservation in government employment and education. It was based on the suggestions made by the Narayan Rane Committee at that moment in time.The Congress-NCP association, which ruled the state from 1999 to 2014, was overthrown in 2014, and Devendra Fadnavis’s government (BJP-Shiv Sena partnership) took over. August 2016, barely two years later, the state was hit hard by the Kopardi rape and murder of a fifteen-year-old girl who belonged to the Maratha community. The discontent among Marathas then resulted in organized demonstrations throughout the state, spearheaded by the Sakal Maratha Samaj and Maratha Kranti Morcha.However, in 2017–18, the protests turned violent. After that, the Fadnavis government took decisive action to address the complex problem. In November 2018, the government approved Marathas’ reservation under the Socially and Educationally Backward Class Act, an unusual provision based on the conclusions of the Backward Class Commission led by M G Gaikwad. By this, the BJP gained an electoral advantage over the then-rival Congress-NCP on account of the reservation.In an effort to strengthen its support among Marathas, the BJP also looked into reservation issues while MVA was in power (2019–2022). It paid off, as the BJP won the most votes in the local body elections. But opponents using Maratha quota politics are once again targeting Deputy Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis, who oversees the critically important home department today. Under the Socially and Educationally Backward Classes (SEBC) Act, 2018, the Bombay High Court affirmed in June 2019 the Maratha quota’s constitutional validity. While the High Court held that the state’s sixteen percent quota was not “justifiable,” it was lowered to thirteen percent in government employment and twelve percent in education, in accordance with the Maharashtra State Backward Class Commission’s recommendation.On the other hand, the HC stated that the reservation cap shouldn’t go above 50%. This restriction, however, may be exceeded in extreme and exceptional circumstances. It stated that this would depend on the availability of quantitative, current data demonstrating backwardness and inadequate representation, without compromising administrative efficiency.The 11-member Maharashtra State Backward Class Commission (MSBCC), led by Justice G M Gaikwad (retd.), was largely relied upon by the court for its conclusions. About 45,000 families from two villages in each of the 355 talukas where the Maratha population is greater than 50% were surveyed by the commission.According to the report turned in on November 15, 2018, the Maratha group lags behind in terms of social, economic, and educational advancement. The HC expressed satisfaction with the facts and noted that the commission had proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the Maratha group was socially, economically, and educationally behind. Additionally, it demonstrated that the Maratha minority was underrepresented in state government jobs.A five-judge Supreme Court Constitution bench led by Justice Ashok Bhushan overturned the Maharashtra law’s reservation provisions for the Maratha community in May 2021, citing the 50% ceiling established by the court in its 1992 Indra Sawhney (Mandal) ruling.Following the Supreme Court’s November 2022 decision upholding the 10% quota for the Economically Weaker Sections, the state administration clarified that economically disadvantaged community members would continue to get benefits under the EWS quota until the Maratha reservation issue was settled.After the SC denied the state government’s review plea in April of this year, the state government announced that it would file a curative petition. Additionally, the administration had announced the formation of a new, specialized body to conduct a thorough assessment of the community’s “backwardness.”The Congress, NCP, Sharad Pawar section, and Shiv Sena (UBT) are now pressuring the government led by Chief Minister Eknath Shinde to resolve the matter of the Maratha reservation in the state. They are pressuring CM Shinde and Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar to take action in favor of the community as the duo who belong to the community, are currently in power.After the violence in several districts, notably, Chief Minister Eknath Shinde announced on Monday (30th October) that the government has constituted an advisory group to look into the Maratha reservation issue. The body will be led by a number of former judges.“We have formed an advisory board on the subject of Maratha reservation under the leadership of retired Justice Bhosle, retired Justice Gaikwad, and retired Justice Shinde. This advisory board will give suggestions to the government on the matter of the Maratha reservation case in the Supreme Court. Along with this, we will also collect empirical data with the help of the Backward Classes Commission in the entire state. So that we can tell the Supreme Court in the curative petition that is pending how backward the Maratha community is,” CM Shinde was quoted as saying. For the sake of the Maratha community, the Maharashtra government declared it would grant Kunbi caste certificates to those Marathas from Marathwada who had documents from the Nizam rule attesting to their status as Kunbis. As of today (October 31), the Maharashtra Revenue Department has started to issue Kunbi certificates to Maratha community members who possess legitimate documentation.The state’s Kunbi community is classified as OBC given that they work in occupations connected to agriculture. If Marathas were granted Kunbi caste certificates, they would become recognized as members of the Kunbi community, receive OBC status, and be eligible for the reservations granted to OBCs.However, the other OBC groups are against Marathas being classified as OBCs for reservation privileges. OBCs make up 52 percent of the state’s population and are divided into 382 castes, whereas Marathas make up 32 percent.Chief Minister Eknath Shinde on Tuesday (31st October) assured activist Manoj Jarange Patil that a concrete decision would be taken in the cabinet meeting regarding the Maratha reservations. He said that the matter regarding giving Kunbi certificates to the Maratha community will also be discussed. CM Shinde also said that the government has filed a curative petition in the Supreme Court. Following a fruitful conversation with Chief Minister Shinde, Manoj Jarange Patil, who was on a hunger strike until his death in order to demand reservations for the Maratha community, ended the fast and consumed water. “The government has filed a curative petition in the Supreme Court for Maratha reservation. Therefore, I am hopeful that the Maratha community will get the reservation soon,” Patil said. #ManojJarange शाहू महाराजांचा मान राखून दोन दिवस पाणी पिणार, पण आरक्षण मिळालं नाहीतर पुन्हा पाणी सोडणार; मनोज जरांगेंचा निर्धार #MarathaReservation https://t.co/kCKQdlO0mhThe Police are said to have arrested around 49 people from Beed for engaging in the horrific violence.

I will never forget the affection shown to me, not only in Andhra Pradesh but also in Telangana and across the world.”“In my 45 years of career, I haven’t committed any mistake and will not let anyone do. All the political parties have supported me, all thanks to them,” he added.Chandrababu Naidu was under 53 days of judicial custody. The interim bail has been granted for four weeks. TDP said that the ruling YSRCP has failed in its attempt to label Chandrababu Naidu as a criminal.“Despite all the efforts by the ruling YSRCP to constantly put N Chandrababu Naidu under scrutiny and label him as a criminal, they finally failed today. This shows how the YSRCP is afraid, scared, intimated and terrified of TDP,” the party said.Chandrababu Naidu was granted bail due to health reasons. He has been ordered to surrender on November 24. The court will hear arguments on the main bail petition on November 10. The TDP supremo has been ordered to not participate in any other program except his medical check-ups at the hospital.The TDP supremo has been ordered to not participate in any other program except his medical check-ups at the hospital. The High Court also ordered Naidu to not participate in Media and Political activities.Meanwhile Andhra Pradesh Bharatiya Janata Party chief Daggubati Purandeswari on Tuesday welcomed the state High Court’s decision to grant interim bail to Telugu Desam Party supremo N Chandrababu Naidu in connection with the skill development case. The Andhra Pradesh BJP chief, however, condemned the arrest of Naidu saying that the crackdown on September 9 was not done in an appropriate way.“We welcome the judgement of the (Andhra Pradesh) High Court for granting interim bail to Chandrababu Naidu. We condemn his arrest as it was not done in an appropriate way. They have made a mistake in the past by arresting without giving notice or without conducting an investigation. The method of arrest without adding his name to the FIR is also not the appropriate way. (But) It is a good sign to get interim bail,” Purandeswari said. (This news report is published from a syndicated feed.

The central agency raided several locations in Mohali, Ludhiana and Amritsar. Central paramilitary forces personnel accompanied the ED officials during the raids. Notably, AAP has promised “drug free Punjab” on several occasions. Recently, CM Bhagwant Mann took an anti-drug oath at Golden Temple. As per the reports, seven ED officials with CRPF personnel reached the premises of Kulwant Singh at around 7:15 AM to conduct searches. At that time, Singh was not at home.Some reports suggest that the raids were linked to a liquor scam case. However, no official statement has been released by the police. Notably, ED has already restricted foreign travel of officials who are responsible for forming liquor policy in Punjab. They cannot travel abroad without ED’s prior permission.ED raids AAP MLA Kulwant Singh in connection with the liquor scam in Delhi and Punjab. Raids are underway at Mohali: SourcesNotably, the opposition in Punjab has been calling for an investigation by ED or CBI into the Punjab Excise Policy. Shiromani Akali Dal has alleged that the Punjab government attempted to replicate the Delhi Excise Policy in the state. Following the summons issued by ED to AAP Chief Arvind Kejriwal, Sukhbir Singh Badal wrote on X, “Twin developments, including the rejection of the bail plea of ex-Delhi CM Manish Sisodia and summoning of Aam Aadmi Party Convener, Arvind Kejriwal in the Delhi Excise Policy Scam on Nov 2, calls for a thorough probe into the Punjab Excise Scam too.”Singh, who is the richest MLA of AAP in Punjab, came under the scanner when the Union Environment Ministry raised concerns over the alleged violation of environmental norms in two projects owned by Singh’s company. The ministry brought the matter to Punjab Governor Banwari Lal Purohit’s notice, after which the Governor wrote to Punjab’s Chief Minister Bhagwant Mann seeking action from the Civic Authority, Punjab Pollution Control Board, and State Level Environment Impact Assessment Authority (SEIAA) over alleged violation of rules. Singh was once with SAD, but he was expelled from the party over allegations of anti-party activities in January 2021. He contested the civic poll independently but lost. Before the 2022 Assembly Elections in Punjab, he joined AAP and won the election from SAS Nagar seat.

61,"31 October, 2023 ",‘Ceasefire in Gaza right now will only benefit Hamas’: White House rejects call for a ceasefire to Israel-Hamas war," However, the White House suggested that instead of a ceasefire, there should be ""pauses"" so that aid can be delivered inside Gaza. He told the media that the White House is “confident” that more aid trucks would be able to enter Gaza via Egypt. On 30th October (Monday), the United States rejected calls for a ceasefire between Israel and the Palestinian Islamist terror outfit Hamas. During the White House press briefing, National Security spokesperson John Kirby asserted that the US does not believe that a ceasefire is the right answer right now. He added that the US does not support a ceasefire at this time.Rejecting the demand for a ceasefire, Kirby said, “We believe that a ceasefire right now benefits Hamas, and Hamas is the only one that would gain from that right now.” The same was pointed out by Former US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton on Monday saying that a ceasefire will be a ‘gift’ for Hamas.  Hillary Clinton:“People who are calling for a ceasefire now do not understand Hamas. That is not possible.”#ceasefire #HamasislSIS pic.twitter.com/DHj8igEGJtHowever, the White House suggested that instead of a ceasefire, there should be “pauses” so that aid can be delivered inside Gaza. He told the media that the White House is “confident” that more aid trucks would be able to enter Gaza via Egypt. He asserted that the US had spoken to the Israeli government about increasing the number of trucks crossing the border each day to around 100. He noted that on Sunday (29th October), around 45 trucks entered Gaza through Egypt’s Rafah Crossing. In the wake of the deadly terror attacks and incursion on 7th October, Israel has vowed that there will be no ceasefire until Hamas is dismantled. Addressing a press conference for foreign media in English, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu also emphasised that there would be no ceasefire to the ongoing war against Hamas as it would mean surrender to terrorism. Netanyahu asserted, “I want to make clear Israel’s position regarding a ceasefire. Just as the United States would not agree to a ceasefire after the bombing of Pearl Harbor, or after the terrorist attack of 9/11, Israel will not agree to a cessation of hostilities with Hamas.” Rejecting calls for a ceasefire, he added, “After the horrific attacks of October 7, calls for a ceasefire are calls for Israel to surrender to Hamas, to surrender to terrorism, to surrender to barbarism. That will not happen.” Quoting a verse from the biblical scripture of Ecclesiastes, the Israeli PM noted, “There is a time for peace and a time for war.” He continued, “This is a time for war. A war for a common future. Today we draw a line between the forces of civilisation and the forces of barbarism. It is a time for everyone to decide where they stand.”He called Hamas’s onslaught “the worst savagery our people have seen since the Holocaust.” Speaking to foreign press representatives, Netanyahu said, “Hamas murdered children in front of their parents, murdered parents in front of their children. They burned people alive, they raped women, they beheaded men, they tortured Holocaust survivors, they kidnapped babies.”He urged civilised nations everywhere to back this fight. He added, “Israel’s fight is your fight because if Hamas and Iran’s axis of evil win, you will be their next target. That’s why Israel’s victory will be your victory. But make no mistake, regardless of who stands with Israel, Israel will fight until this battle is won, and Israel will prevail.” Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

62,"31 October, 2023 ","Opposition MPs supposedly get ‘state-sponsored attack’ notification from Apple, govt orders probe: How Apple itself says their notifications are unreliable"," Interestingly, Apple itself on its website states that these so-called ""state-sponsored threats"" to their users' devices are not reliable.In a new political potboiler, some iPhone-using Opposition leaders have claimed to have received “threat alerts” from Apple. “ALERT: State-sponsored attackers may be targeting your iPhone,” the threat notification sent on iMessage and Apple Mail reads.The notification has reportedly been received by Opposition leaders across party lines including Mahua Moitra, Shashi Tharoor, Pawan Khera, KC Venugopal, Priyanka Chaturvedi, Raghav Chadha, Asaduddin Owaisi, and some others.Taking to X, formerly Twitter, Congress MP Shashi Tharoor wrote, “Received from an Apple ID, [email protected], which I have verified.

Tharoor later deleted the tweeted ad re-posted the screenshot with his email masked. Ironically, it would certainly not take sophisticated state-sponsored hackers to break into the device security of someone, an MP no less, who is not aware of basic protocols that one must follow to keep their devices safe – like not making public vital details attached to your accounts. Similarly dramatic responses were seen coming from Pawan Khera on X, who put the onus of the alleged “threat” on PM Modi saying, “Dear Modi Sarkar, why are you doing this?”Dear Modi Sarkar, why are you doing this? pic.twitter.com/3hWmAx00qlTrinamool Congress MP Mahua Moitra, who recently confessed to giving her Parliamentary login credentials to Darshan Hiranandani who submitted questions against Adani, wrote on X calling Adani and PMO bullies.Received text & email from Apple warning me Govt trying to hack into my phone & email. @HMOIndia – get a life.

Detecting such attacks relies on threat intelligence signals that are often imperfect and incomplete.”“It’s possible that some Apple threat notifications may be false alarms, or that some attacks are not detected. We are unable to provide information about what causes us to issue threat notifications, as that may help state-sponsored attackers adapt their behaviour to evade detection in the future,” Apple states on the support page on its website.Moreover, it says that Apple is “unable to provide information about what causes us to issue threat notifications”. This means that it is not clear whatsoever whether the alleged attack, that is if it is indeed an attack, is state-sponsored at all. And even if it is “state-sponsored” then there is no telling which state.In fact, after the dramatic press conference of Rahul Gandhi where he directly blamed the Modi government of snooping on “opposition members”, Apple issued a stetement reiterating their position on such threat messages. ""Apple does not attribute the threat notifications to any specific state-sponsored attacker. State-sponsored attackers are very well-funded and sophisticated, and their attacks evolve over time.

We are unable to provide information about what causes us to issue threat notifications, as that may help state-sponsored attackers adapt their behavior to evade detection in the future”. According to information available on the tech-giant’s website, “Apple threat notifications are designed to inform and assist users who may have been targeted by state-sponsored attackers.”“These users are individually targeted because of who they are or what they do. Unlike traditional cybercriminals, state-sponsored attackers apply exceptional resources to target a very small number of specific individuals and their devices, which makes these attacks much harder to detect and prevent. State-sponsored attacks are highly complex, cost millions of dollars to develop and often have a short shelf life. The vast majority of users will never be targeted by such attacks,” the company states.Apple has also laid down measures to prevent and combat such threats. “To verify that an Apple threat notification is genuine, sign in to appleid.apple.com. If Apple has sent you a threat notification, it will be clearly visible at the top of the page after you have signed in.”After the fiasco, the Modi government has ordered a probe into the alleged security breach. Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw said, “We are concerned by the statements we have seen in media from some MPs as well as others about a notification received by them from Apple. The notification received by them as per media reports mentions about ‘state-sponsored attacks’ on their devices”. He further said, “Information by Apple on this issue seems vague and non-specific in nature. Apple states these notifications may be based on information which is ‘incomplete or imperfect’. It also states that some Apple threat notifications may be false alarms or some attacks are not detected. Apple has also claimed that Apple IDs are securely encrypted on devices, making it extremely difficult to access or identify them without the user’s explicit permission. This encryption safeguards the user’s Apple ID and ensures that it remains private and protected. The Government of Bharat takes its role of protecting the privacy and security of all citizens very seriously and will investigate to get to the bottom of these notifications. In light of such information and widespread speculation, we have also asked Apple to join the investigation with real, accurate information on the alleged state-sponsored attacks”. On 25th August last year, the Supreme Court said that no conclusive proof emerged to support the claim that the Indian government was using the controversial Pegasus spyware to snoop on people.The then Chief Justice of India NV Ramana said that the apex court-appointed committee probing the matter has concluded that the Israeli spyware was not found in the 29 mobile phones it examined.The controversy erupted on 18th July 2021, when a group of media networks and investigative reporters claimed that among the 50,000 phone numbers chosen for infection with the Pegasus malware were those of Indian ministers, legislators, activists, entrepreneurs, and journalists.Notably, Israel-based company NSO which built the spyware, claims that it only deals with governments and not private entities. However, it never disclosed who its clients were. Several international media outlets, including The Wire from India, released a series of reports claiming the Indian government used the spyware.The reports were based on an “analysis” done by a team of Amnesty International. It is notable that the Supreme Court-appointed committee had also used the tool develop by Amnesty to detect the spyware, along with various other tools.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

Taking to X, he took a dig at Congress stalwart Rahul Gandhi and Kerala CM Pinarayi Vijayan for coming together and ‘jointly’ filing a case against him. He asserted that with such a coercive step, they are trying to threaten him for exposing their appeasement of Hamas. The Minister insinuated that both parties have united for appeasement purposes only, as at the state level both of them have been taking antithetical positions except on a few such issues. He also lambasted both political leaders calling them the biggest appeasers in Indian politics. He emphasised that they had been appeasing “poisonous, radical and violent” organisations like SDPI, PFI, and Hamas who have threatened the security of the Indian state.  Minister Rajeev Chandrashekhar tweeted, “So the two INDI alliance partners Rahul Gandhi and Pinarayi Vijayan have jointly filed a “case” against me.

It started when Chandrasekhar criticised Kerala CM for not acting tough on calls for Jihad by Hamas terrorists and the mindset of killing which resulted in the bomb blasts.  Following the incident, he posted on X, “Dirty shameless appeasement politics by a discredited CM (and HM) Pinarayi Vijayan besieged by corruption charges. Sitting in Delhi and protesting against Israel, when in Kerala open calls by Terrorist Hamas for Jihad is causing attacks and bomb blasts on innocent Christians.” Dirty shameless appeasement politics by a discredited CM (and HM) @pinarayivijayan besieged by corruption charges Sitting in Delhi and protesting against Israel , when in Kerala open calls by Terrorist Hamas for Jihad is causing attacks and bomb blasts on innocent christians https://t.co/MQH0ycZsquA day later, on 30th October, a verbal duel ensued between the CM and Chandrasekhar.

64,"31 October, 2023 ",‘Found your choice of interviewee sickening’: Israel’s Ambassador to India Naor Gilon slams ‘The Hindu’ for interviewing Hamas’s Mousa Abu Marzouk," The Israeli Ambassador to India, who recently spoke about the possible involvement of Islamic State (ISIS) in the Hamas attack on Israel, chastised The Hindu's Editor-in-Chief for failing to demonstrate responsible journalismIsraeli Ambassador to India, Sri Lanka and Bhutan, Naor Gilon on Tuesday, October 31, tore into The Hindu for providing a platform to Hamas official Mousa Abu Marzouk. In an open letter to the media house’s editor-in-chief Suresh Nambath, Naor Gilon said that he found the publication’s “choice of interviewee sickening.”My letter to the Editor-in-Chief of @the_hindu expressing my dismay for giving a platform to a #HamasISIS arch-terrorist. This is a shameful interview. pic.twitter.com/yF82UGwZxLReferring to the interview of Hamas official Mousa Abu Marzouk published in Frontline, the fortnightly English magazine from The Hindu on October 27, Naor Gilon said that he was writing the letter to express his extreme disappointment at the publication’s choice to interview Mousa Abu Marzouk, whom he called a known terrorist from the Hamas-ISIS.Notably, on October 27, amid the ongoing Hamas-Israel conflict, The Hindu’s fortnightly magazine The Frontline published an interview of Hamas official Mousa Abu Marzouk typically in line with several other Indian leftist media portals and political parties like the Congress which have been consistently trying to garner sympathy for Hamas while demonizing Israel ever since the Palestinian terrorist group Hamas launched an audacious attack on Israel that killed hundreds of innocent Israeli civilians, including infants and the elderly.The Frontline article was titled, “‘The root of the problem is the occupation’: Moussa Abu Marzouk”. The archive version of the article can be viewed here.Though the Israeli Ambassador to India acknowledged the press has the right to provide a platform to diverse voices, he questioned the media outlet whether it would have been willing to provide a platform to terrorists like Ajmal Kasab or Osama Bin Laden to explain their rationale behind the 26/11 Mumbai attack and the 9/11 terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon.Naor Gilon said he was disturbed that The Hindu considered providing space to Mousa Abu Marzouk, whom he referred to as ‘not just a controversial figure but a known terrorist with gallons of Israeli blood on his hands’.“Abu Marzuk, a member of the terror organization Hamas-ISIS which has been listed as a terror organization by many countries of the world including the US, all EU members, UK and others -is responsible for the deaths of thousands of innocent Israeli civilians since 1988. He has spent time in US prison for his actions. The decision to grant him a platform, especially in the wake of the tragic 7th of October Nazi-attacks, where 1400 Israelis, including babies, women and Holocaust survivors were tortured to death in the worst possible ways – is deeply unsettling,” the letter read.The Israeli Ambassador to India, who recently spoke about the possible involvement of Islamic State (ISIS) in the Hamas attack on Israel, chastised The Hindu’s Editor-in-Chief for failing to demonstrate responsible journalism. “It is incumbent upon responsible journalism to exercise due diligence in such cases, ensuring that the voices amplified do not contribute to the promotion of violence and terror,” Naor Gilon said, further slamming the publication for not considering the need for fact-checking or asking follow up questions to Abu Marzuk, which, in turn, assisted the Hamas official to decimate lies and fake news with utmost ease.“In a 1806 word article, less than 100 words could be considered something others than blatant lies and defamation, by any person who knows an iota about the reality between Israel and Hamas. This is an old and known Terrorist tactic utilized by Hamas-ISIS regularly: Lie and Murder, if possible – Lie about the Murder,” the letter read.While highlighting the importance of responsible journalism yet again, Israeli Ambassador to India Naor Gilon also pointed out that failing to accurately fact-check and follow up on false statements, especially when the issue is of such grave consequence, not only damages the publication’s credibility but also shows disrespect for the numerous victims who, in this case, were brutally killed in the attack on Israel on October 7 by terrorists from Hamas.“Not long ago it was the duty of journalists to hold their subjects accountable for their statements and their actions. To fact check. To follow up false statements with accuracy. particularly when they pertain to matters of so grave consequence. Failing to do so not only undermines the credibility of the publication it also disrespects the countless dead victims whose blood screams from the ground. Worst of all, publishing a manifesto of a terrorist, poses a real risk of radicalizing and empowering susceptible readers to take more violent actions in the name of these “pseudo facts” claimed by terrorists. We’ve had more than our share of Jews murdered for these reasons so we should be taken seriously when we say: “Some words do kill”, Naor Gilon wrote.He ended his letter by expressing his dismay over the interview with Hamas-ISIS mass murderer Moussa Abu Marzuk, saying it casts severe questions on media ethics and standards. In light of this occurrence, he hoped The Hindu would reflect on this and take appropriate action to guarantee that future interviews are carried out with the diligence and honesty that their readers deserve.On 7th October (local time), the terrorist organisation Hamas launched a brutal terror attack on Israeli soil. Over 1,200 people were killed in the attack. Paragliders and vehicle-borne Hamas terrorists wielding automatic weapons barged inside the border walls and attacked civilians, residential communities, and even a music festival in Southern Israel. In response to the brutal terrorist attack on Israel that killed over 1,000 civilians and wounded over 2,500 others, Israel declared war on Hamas and has been pounding the Gaza Strip with bombs since then.The US and other NATO nations have declared support for Israel. Hundreds of Israelis and foreign nationals are believed to have been taken hostage by Hamas. Hamas has massacred civilians brutally after attacking a music festival, and family homes in Southern Israel. Social media posts have surfaced where Hamas terrorists are seen killing children, women, and the elderly. The exact number of hostages is unknown.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds. In name of saving democracy, they get money from various sources.

65,"31 October, 2023 ","Selectively leaked videos and motivated narratives: Assam Rifles DG talks about the situation in Manipur, vows to bring back normalcy"," Lt Gen Nair said that the Assam Rifles were targeted by people of both factions, the Meitei and Kuki communities at one point.Director General of Assam Rifles, Lieutenant General PC Nair, in an interview with The Indian Express rubbished all allegations of bias that were leveled against the force in the wake of Manipur violence that started six months ago.Calling the bias allegations false, Lt Gen Nair said that the Assam Rifles were targeted by people of both factions, the Meitei and Kuki communities at one point. He said that several videos from Myanmar were selectively circulated and did not provide the full picture.Speaking about the challenges that prevail in the state, he pointed at people’s mindset and the large number of weapons in circulation that continue to be a major cause for concern.Lt Gen Nair said, “I think it will take some time for it to revert to what it was earlier. During such periods, selectively leaked videos or motivated narratives tend to go viral, with individuals manipulating them for personal gain. These represent vested interests from which people must be safeguarded.”He further added, “The number of weapons that went missing from various police stations are close to 5,000, of which about 1,600 weapons are back today — a positive development, though it will take time before we get all the missing weapons back.”“There were instances when people of a community were going en masse to attack the other after being fed with a certain narrative. And here, we stopped them. So obviously, when emotions are running high and they are prevented from doing what they want to, stories get cooked up,” Lt Gen Nair added.“When all this started, the security forces had never worked in conjunction with each other, both the police and the central forces. But the significant improvement is that today, every operation is carried out jointly. You have AR, Army, BSF, CRPF, and local police – all five or six components working together for a specific operation, be it searching for weapons or apprehending wrongdoers. The police and our operations are now better synchronised, enabling us to restore normalcy more effectively,” Lt Gen Nair said.When asked by The Indian Express about the “assurances from the state government” on the removal of Assam Rifles from buffer zones and replacing them with paramilitary forces, Lt Gen Nair said, “Why should there be such plans? We are there everywhere — in the plains, hills and in between in the buffer zones. Our officers and men are doing their job to the best of their abilities and in a highly professional manner. For us, bringing back normalcy is the most important job at hand and we shall persevere to do that.”Two months after violent clashes broke out in Manipur in May, locals began pointing fingers at the forces who were tasked with preventing a repeat of the violence and disarming local armed groups. Tensions also ensued between the state government and the Assam Rifles with the Manipur police filing an FIR against them.In September, the Delhi Meitei Coordination Committee (DMCC) submitted a memorandum to Defence Minister Rajnath Singh accusing the Assam Rifles of “biased treatment”.They reportedly mentioned that the protests by Meitei groups were dealt with lathi-charge, rubber bullets, tear gas, and even live bullets being fired whereas protests by Kukis were dealt with differently.Protests were held by Meitei women’s groups in some areas in Manipur accusing the Assam Rifles of bias against the community. Demands increased for the removal of the force from some areas.Videos went viral on social media in September showing altercations between the Manipur police and Assam Rifles personnel. The state police also filed a criminal case against the force for “obstruction of duty” and “criminal intimidation”.The police accused the personnel of the 9th battalion of the Assam Rifles of the “arrogant act” of “giving a chance to the accused Kuki militants to escape freely to a safe zone”.Among other challenges that the Central force was faced with was anti-social elements camouflaging as the Assam Rifles. On 18th September, the Assam Rifles wrote to the Manipur police alerting them that a “few miscreants with the help of valley-based insurgent groups have acquired many used Tata 407 from the civil market and have converted them to resemble the vehicles being used by the Assam Rifles and putting the AR insignia”.Meanwhile, the force continues to take measures to restore normalcy in the hill state of Manipur. Speaking about the same, Lt Gen Nair said that the Assam Rifles have been reaching out to all violence-affected people and have established camps for them, rendered medical aid, evacuated thousands, prevented several places from getting burned, and helped schools restart and children relocate.“We are also helping the government in distribution of essential supplies and facilitating the reopening of the national highways. All this is kind of adding up to restoring normalcy. In one line, we are making our work do the talking,” Lt Gen Nair concluded.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

While Senior Advocate Sankarnaryan appearing for Mahua Moitra, was putting forth his submisisons, Adv Jai Anant Dehradrai, against whom also injunction was sought, objected to him appearing in the case.Dehedrai appeared in person and told the court that Sankaranarayanan contacted him the night before and asked him to withdraw his CBI complaint in exchange for the dog. Following these submissions, Sankarnaryan withdrew from the case.Speaking to the media outside the court complex Gopal Sankarnaryan said “I have absolutely no comments except to say, because Jai (Advocate Jai Anant Dehadrai) instructed me in a case, I had reached out to him yesterday and had asked him is there were any way of exploring a settlement. Jai had said that he would get back to me, but he didn’t. Today when I appeared, Jai personally said to me he had an objection to my appearance. I immediately withdrew and said that I don’t want to do this case.”The Delhi High Court earlier had issued notices to the defendants on Moitra’s suit. Moitra is at the centre of a political storm after BJP MP Nishikant Dubey complained to Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla that she had allegedly taken bribes from a business house to ask questions in Parliament.Earlier Nishikant Dubey in his letter to the Lok Sabha Speaker, titled “Reemergence of nasty ‘Cash for Query’ in Parliament” had alleged “‘serious Breach of Privilege’, ‘Contempt of the House’ and a ‘Criminal Offence’ under Section 120A of IPC” by the Trinamool Congress MP.Dubey claimed that an Advocate, Jai Anant Dehadrai had provided him with proof of a bribe. In her response to this letter, the TMC MP had said that she would welcome a probe by the speaker after he dealt with alleged breach of privilege by other BJP MPs.(This news report is published from a syndicated feed.

The UK government, on the other hand, has traditionally endorsed the concept of ""humanitarian pauses"" but not requests for a total ceasefire.On Monday (30th October), United Kingdom Prime Minister Rishi Sunak dismissed an MP from his government after he advocated for a “permanent ceasefire” in Gaza amid the ongoing conflict after the Palestinian terrorist group Hamas attacked Israel on 7th October. In a letter to the Prime Minister last week, Conservative MP Paul Bristow, who worked as Technology Secretary Michelle Donelan’s legislative private secretary, advocated for a permanent ceasefire in Gaza.On 26th October, Bristow stated that a “permanent ceasefire” in Gaza would save lives and allow supplies to reach those in need. The UK government, on the other hand, has traditionally endorsed the concept of “humanitarian pauses” but not requests for a total ceasefire.“My constituents and I are deeply grieved by the heart-breaking and devastating humanitarian crisis now unfolding in Gaza. Thousands have been killed and more than one million are now displaced,” the letter read. #BREAKING: UK PM Rishi Sunak fires Conservative MP Paul Bristow from his government post after he called for a ceasefire in Gaza. pic.twitter.com/y9rsEUiZHxThe now-former government adviser additionally cautioned against “collective punishment” of Gaza residents “for the crimes of Hamas.” Bristow, the Conservative MP for Peterborough, is one of the handful of Conservative MPs who have called for a ceasefire in Gaza.In the letter, Bristow also stated that some of his people have been “directly affected” by the ongoing war. “It is difficult to understand how this makes Israel more secure or indeed makes anything better,” said the member of parliament for the Tories.The UK government, along with several other Western countries, has frequently said that Israel has the right to self-defense.Earlier this month, the UK Prime Minister visited Israel and met with his Israeli counterpart, Benjamin Netanyahu, to express his country’s support at its “darkest hour” in its ongoing conflict with the Palestinian terrorist group Hamas.Sunak also offered millions of dollars in humanitarian help to Gaza people during his speech to parliament last week.The Tory MP also stated that ordinary Palestinians must not face unified punishment for Hamas’s crimes. “I shall reiterate at every opportunity that ordinary people are not Hamas, and every innocent life in Gaza is precious. We must do everything we can to preserve life,” Bristow concluded. The Downing Street Spokesperson confirmed the development and said that the Tory MP from Peterborough has been asked to leave his post in government. “This is due to his comments that were not consistent with the principles of collective responsibility,” he was quoted as saying. In this context, collective responsibility refers to the rule that all public servants are expected to openly support government policy, regardless of their personal opinions about it.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

Israel has been conducting strikes on Hamas and its terror infrastructure in Gaza in retaliation to the deadly terrorist attacks on 7th October.The controversial statement from the SP MP is not a first. The Samajwadi Party MP has made communal statements over several issues in the past.

He had also asserted that chanting Vande Mataram was against the tenets of Islam.The Samajwadi Party leader was earlier booked for hailing the Taliban and comparing the radical Islamist outfit to Indian freedom fighters. He was also booked in connection to violent protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) in Sambhal district of Uttar Pradesh.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

70,"31 October, 2023 ",Pro-Khalistani clothing line uses Shubh controversy to promote hoodie celebrating Indira Gandhi’s assassination: Here is what happened," Both the hoodies are strikingly similar, and the video being circulated is of low quality, giving the impression that Shubh held a pro-Khalistani hoodie. On 29th October (local time), controversial rapper Shubh was apparently “tricked” into holding a hoodie during his concert in London that looked like a newly launched hoodie with artwork celebrating the assassination of former Prime Minister of India Indira Gandhi. A video of Shubh holding the hoodie was shared by a Khalistani X account SherePanjabUK which is withheld in India. The post read, “Panjabi Artist Shubh holding a hoodie of an illustration that shows Indian PM Indira Gandhi (aka maimuna begum) being greeted by Shaheed Bhai Satwant Singh and Shaheed Bhai Beant Singh #NeverForget84.” The video went viral on social media after several pro-Khalistani accounts shared the video. ਵੈਰ ਸਾਡੇ ਨਾਲ, ਛੋਟੇ Dead-End ਨੀਂ Footage from lastnight at the 02 of #shubhworldwide holding the hoodie of Indira Gandhi being greeted by Shaheed Bhai Satwant Singh & Shaheed Bhai Beant Singh– ਖ਼ਾਲਿਸਤਾਨ ਜਿੰਦਾਬਾਦ pic.twitter.com/g7Vrw9snWfHowever, OpIndia’s investigation into the video and the hoodie revealed the hoodie Shubh held on the stage had a Punjab map and not pro-Khalistani artwork. When we zoomed in and enhanced the image of the hoodie Shubh was holding, it was clear that Shubh held the hoodie with a Punjab map outlining the districts. However, the hoodie that promoted the pro-Khalistani agenda showed the assassination of Indira Gandhi. Both the hoodies are strikingly similar, and the video being circulated is of low quality, giving the impression that Shubh held a pro-Khalistani hoodie. The hoodie was created by a pro-Khalistani clothing line, Akaal Clothing, that shared the video on their Instagram account as well. From the video, it appears the hoodie was handed over to Shubh by someone in the audience. He looked at the artwork and then flaunted it towards the crowd. In the pro-Khalistani artwork, the date of Indira Gandhi’s assassination, which was 31st October 1984, was printed. Akaal Clothing is using the controversy around Shubh’s now-cancelled India tour to promote the recently launched hoodie. On 23rd March 2023, Shubhneet Singh alias Shubh posted a story on his Instagram account captioned “Pray for Punjab”, showing a distorted map of India. He posted a photo of the map without the union territory of Jammu and Kashmir, Punjab, and North-eastern states. This post was clearly an attempt to challenge the sovereignty of India and peddle the Khalistan narrative. The Canadian singer did this at a time when the Punjab Police was on the lookout to nab Khalistani terrorist Amritpal Singh. Shubh had openly supported Khalistani elements at the time.In September, he announced his India tour in association with BookMyShow and the tour was sponsored by the Indian brand boAt. As the controversy around the distorted map resurfaced, first boAt stepped back from sponsorship, and later, BookMyShow announced that the concert was cancelled. Leading celebrities, including Indian cricketer Viral Kohli, unfollowed him on Instagram amid the backlash. Short video creating platform Moj also removed his songs. Shubh and the artist who created the artwork remained silent for a long and spoke only after Shubh’s tour was cancelled. However, by then, it was too late, and people questioned why they remained silent and did not apologise earlier.Terming India as his country, Shubhneet Singh said his “ancestors and Gurus did not blink an eye” when it came to making sacrifices for the country’s freedom. “India is MY country, too. I was born here. It is the land of my GURUS and my ANCESTORS, who didn’t even blink an eye to make sacrifices for the freedom of this land, for its glory, and for the family. And Punjab is my soul, Punjab is in my blood. Whatever I am today, I am because of being a Punjabi,” he said in a post on Instagram.Earlier, the artist Inkquisitive who created the distorted map played victim and blamed Kangana Ranaut, social media and “powerheads” for the controversy. However, he stood by his creation and released another version of it. Amandeep Singh claimed that the ‘artwork’ published on 21st March this year aimed at highlighting the blackout in Punjab and merely depicting a policeman taking the switch out of the Punjab region. The artist further mentioned that he did not intend to offend anyone while depicting the northern side of the map as faded or missing; however, he did intend to highlight this area as dark due to the blackout.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

71,"31 October, 2023 ",Pakistan shuts down Afghan schools as it asks 1.7 million refugees to leave country by November 1," As many as 86,000 undocumented Afghan nationals have so far returned to their country while one hundred and forty-nine families returned to Afghanistan in one hundred and seventy-four trucks during the last twenty-four hours.Following Pakistan’s decision to expel nearly 1.7 million foreign nationals, primarily Afghans, schools teaching Afghan children in Pakistan have started closing their doors for them, reported Khaama Press.The closure of schools is primarily affecting Afghan girls in Pakistan as it may mark the end of their education for the foreseeable future.Leading to this, many of these Afghan women are forced to return to Afghanistan, where the Taliban government has already prohibited them from accessing secondary education.The Pakistani government initiated an extensive crackdown on the estimated 1.7 million Afghans residing in the country without legal status, leaving them until October 31 to leave or face mass arrests, Khaama Press reported.Sixteen-year-old Nargis Rezaei, along with her family, sought refuge in Pakistan in August 2021 when the Taliban regained control of Afghanistan and said, “We came here to be educated, to have a good life.”“Not every Afghan wants to return to Afghanistan, especially girls who have minimal freedom there,” she added.The fear of deportation has led to a significant drop in school attendance and a two-third decrease in enrollment, which has resulted in the closure of these schools, according to Khaama Press. Moreover, the United Nations (UN) reported a significant rush of Afghan migrants into Pakistan since the Taliban’s takeover, with at least 600,000 individuals crossing the border.Reportedly, the mass deportation shows the dire situation in Afghanistan, as they have been forced to take refugee for their safety in neighbouring countries like Pakistan due to the uncertainty and instability.This calls for the urgent need for humanitarian assistance and international support to address the needs of Afghan migrants, who are left with no other choice but to flee from their homeland in search of security and a better future, reported Khaama Press.As many as 86,000 undocumented Afghan nationals have so far returned to their country while one hundred and forty-nine families returned to Afghanistan in one hundred and seventy-four trucks during the last twenty-four hours.Since October, Pakistan’s interim government issued a deadline of November 1 for over 1.7 million undocumented migrants in the country to depart.The strict warning by the Pakistan government implied that those who fail to comply with this ultimatum may face imprisonment and deportation.According to Khaama Press, as the deadline approaches, reports revealed that a sense of fear and apprehension has intensified among the migrant community in Pakistan.(This news report is published from a syndicated feed.

He termed the internal fights an “unfortunate” situation asserting that the I.N.D.I.A. bloc is not in good shape. He said, “It is unfortunate that the condition of the INDIA Alliance is not strong right now.

Alliance partners Congress and Samajwadi Party (SP) have been fighting over the seat-sharing formula for the state assembly elections in Madhya Pradesh slated for next month. Akhilesh Yadav accused the Congress of ‘betrayal’ and fielded 33 candidates in Madhya Pradesh. In retaliation, the leaders of the grand old party and the likes of UP Congress Chief Ajay Rai and Former MP CM Kamal Nath made verbal attacks against the SP party Chief.  Additionally, Yadav also launched attacks on Congress for asking a nationwide caste census asserting that it was being done only for political benefit. While participating in the Lok Jagran Abhiyan program in Hardoi, he asserted that it is a ‘miracle’ that Congress is ‘now’ asking for a caste census.On its part, the Congress unit in Uttar Pradesh challenged the SP Chief on his own home turf by putting up posters portraying ‘Ajay Rai as CM’ and ‘Rahul Gandhi as PM’. It was seen as a tit-for-tat move as just three days earlier SP had installed posters in Uttar Pradesh’s Lucknow showing Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav as the future prime minister of India.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

In a regulatory filing, the Mumbai-based auto major announced that it has won the Singur automobile manufacturing facility case against West Bengal Industrial Development Corporation (WBIDC).

As per the arbitral award, it will recover more than Rs 765 crores with interest from the WBIDC for the losses it incurred in the now-defunct Singur plant. In an exchange filing, Tata Motors said, “The aforesaid pending arbitral proceedings before a three-member Arbitral Tribunal has now been finally disposed of by a unanimous award in favour of Tata Motors Limited (TML) whereby the claimant (TML) has been held to be entitled to recover from the respondent (WBIDC) a sum of Rs.765.78 crores with interest thereon @ 11% p.a. from 1st September 2016, till actual recovery thereof.” It added, “The Claimant (TML) has also been held to be entitled to recover from the respondent (WBIDC) a sum of Rs.1 crore towards the cost of the proceedings.”The case pertains to Tata Motors’ claim for compensation from WBIDC. This claim covered various aspects, including the loss of capital investments, related to the Singur automobile manufacturing facility which had to be shifted after stiff protest by the then opposition leader Mamata Banerjee. Back in 2006, the erstwhile Left Front government in Bengal had acquired around 1,000 acres of land in Singur and Hooghly. Subsequently, it handed it over to Tata Motors for the purpose of building a Tata Nano manufacturing facility for job creation in the state.However, the land acquisition was opposed by the then opposition leader and Trinamool Congress chief Mamata Banerjee, the current Chief Minister of West Bengal. As a result, Tata Motors had to shelve the Singur project but by then it had already invested over Rs 1,000 crore in the Singur plant. The automobile major later shifted to Gujarat and set up a plant in Sanand for manufacturing the Tata Nano. Tata Motors inaugurated a new plant to manufacture its Nano cars in Sanand in June 2010 almost two years after it was forced to shift the plant out of West Bengal because of Mamata Banerjee-led protest against the land acquisition. The Tata Nano’s Sanand plant was inaugurated by the then-Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi along with Tata Group Chairman Ratan Tata.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

BREAKING:Israel’s President Yitzchak Herzog has confirmed that the German-Israeli citizen Shani Louk has been found beheaded.He tells @BILD:“Her skull was found. That means those barbaric, sadistic animals simply chopped off her head.” pic.twitter.com/pIpHDlfjEbProlific Israeli lawyer also took to X to confirm the same. I’ve seen a lot of posts saying Shani Louk’s body was found. In reality it is a piece of her skull that was found and identified. The rest of her body has not actually been found. The assumption right now is that she was beheaded.The last video of her head intact was shared on… pic.twitter.com/42QnDUjGl3After the 7th October massacre by Hamas in which over 1500 Israeli civilians were massacred by the Islamic terrorists, a horrific video had surfaced where a partially naked woman was merciless being carried at the back of a truck. Her legs seemed to be broken and the Palestinian men who were abducting her were desecrating her and spitting on her. Her mother had first raised alarm after identifying the distinct tattoos that Louk had on her leg, visible in the video. The gruesome video showed terrorists shouting the Islamic slogan ‘Allah Hu Akbar’ while the partially naked body of a woman, later identified as Shani Louk, being paraded in a pickup truck. In some videos that surfaced on social media, a murderous crowd of Hamas terrorists could be seen surrounding the vehicle, chanting slogans and spitting on the woman’s body.The video inspired widespread outrage. Amidst the outrage, a teary, hopeful mother had released a video expressing her hope that Louk was perhaps still alive. In a self-recorded video message published by the Wall Street Journal, her mother, Ricarda Louk, had stated that a family friend in the Gaza Strip has told her that her daughter was alive in a Hamas hospital. However, she added that her condition is critical and every minute is important as her daughter had suffered a serious head injury during the Hamas terror attack. She further pleaded before the German government and urged them not to raise the argument of jurisdiction and ‘act’ to ensure Shani’s safe return from the Gaza Strip. She urged, “One should not argue about the question of jurisdiction. One must act quickly to get Shani out of the Gaza Strip. This is really my desperate call to the entire country of Germany to help me get my Shani back home healthy.” These were, of course, the hopeful cries of a mother. An unconfirmed source had told her that her daughter could potentially be alive and she was all too willing to believe it, urging the authorities to get her daughter back home safe. It is not unthinkable that a mother would pray for her daughter’s safe recovery after a video shows the fate she had potentially met at the hands of barbarians. Any mother would think of the worst. Any mother would sit and wonder the pain that her daughter endured at the hands of the beasts. Was she raped. Was she beaten. Was she tortured. Is she alive? How did she die – these are questions that a mother is bound to go over in her head a thousand times. In the moments of darkest despair, the despair of a mother losing a child, even an unconfirmed tip acts as a ray of hope. Hope that maybe her daughter is beaten, but alive. Maybe she would come home safe. A mother’s hope in the face of inhuman brutality by Hamas is understandable and even expected. However, Islamists who have been desperately trying to drum up sympathy for Hamas under the garb of fighting for the rights of Palestinians, used the mother’s hopeful cries to whitewash the barbarity unleashed by the Islamist terrorist group against the civilian population of Israel in the 7th October terror attack. Kavish Aziz, who claims to be a journalist and was formerly associated with Amar Ujala and Dainik Bhaskar took to X to cast aspersions on Israel, essentially insinuating that Israel could have shot Shani Louk themselves. He also claimed that Palestinians took great care of Shani Louk.

Also Shani’s account was public on Instagram but suddenly her account turned private which gives indication that she is alive CC: @InformeOrwell @EmmaRincon #Palestine #PalestineIsraelwar pic.twitter.com/dqw0DkiEObIrena Akbar, former Indian Express “journalist” and Islamist, who had taken to X to justify the ill-treatment of Louk after the video had surfaced, also tweeted about the mother’s statement. She essentially said that Hindus would be upset that she was not murdered by Hamas because that would deprive them of painting Muslims as “evil and brutal”. She also claimed that the news of Hamas raping and spitting on her was “exaggerated” and an example of “Islamophobia”. It is pertinent to realise that most of these Muslims who were quick to believe that Louk was being ill-treated and then murdered by Hamas pretended to fight for the rights of Palestinians. But every atrocity that has been perpetrated by Hamas is often branded as “Zionist propaganda” by these very Muslims. It is evident that they were more than happy to believe the hopeful words of Louk’s mother not because they were hoping that innocent civilians would be found alive, but so they could use her to claim that all the documented evidence of Hamas’ brutality against Israelis were in fact “Zionist propaganda” and that not only the Palestinians but also Hamas was innocent of the crimes they were being accused of. While there were several images of the charred bodies of babies, women and men, videos of Israelis being beheaded, images of their homes being burnt and Jews being tortured to death on the streets of Israel, the Islamists picked a statement from a grieving mother in an attempt to discredit all the atrocities that were committed by Hamas. Essentially, the Islamists tried to claim that since Louk was alive (she isn’t), it would mean that all the documented atrocities by Hamas should be viewed with a pinch of salt and suspicion. The assertion was simple – the Jews are making up stories of their own persecution because they hate Muslims, that Hamas did not commit the atrocities they are being accused of and by extension, any offensive by Israel against Hamas and Palestine is one that is unjustified. The conclusion to this sinister campaign by the Islamists was for the Islamists to be treated as the actual victims and the Israelis to be viewed as the supremacists who were weaving fantastical tails to demonise Muslims. While the Islamists are still attempting to whitewash the crimes of Hamas, Shani Louk’s skull has been found, giving rise to the conclusion by the Israeli President that after being stripped, paraded naked and desecrated, she was probably beheaded by Hamas. As evidence of atrocities by Hamas mounts, Islamists from India and across the world continue to extend support to Hamas hiding behind the veil of supporting human rights for Palestinians.

Subsequently, he appeared at the Maharashtra Cyber office in Mumbai. Notably, the Fairplay app which has come under the scanner is a subsidiary app of the Mahadev app, promoters of which have links with Dawood Ibrahim’s D-company and are being probed in a money laundering case by the Enforcement Directorate.#WATCH | Maharashtra Police Cyber Cell is questioning rapper Badshah in Mumbai, in connection with the online betting company app 'FairPlay'. pic.twitter.com/QAcEYqk7LyNotably, Aditya Prateek Singh Sisodia, professionally known as Badshah has been accused by Viacom 18 for violating its Intellectual Property Rights (IPR). According to reports, the Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) to stream the IPL 2023 matches were owned by Viacom18. However, Fairplay was screening the cricket competition concurrently from March 2023 to May 2023.The network had lodged a police complaint against the rapper and 40 other individuals, which included actor Sanjay Dutt. They have been accused of endorsing the use of a betting app called Fairplay which was illegally broadcasting the Indian Premier League (IPL) matches.Viacom 18 highlighted that it had the Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) to stream the IPL matches. It pointed out that the matches were illegally streamed on Fairplay and some actors promoted the tournament on the Fairplay app. Viacom 18 also said that the digital piracy by the Fairplay app cost them a loss of Rs 100 crores.Subsequently, a case of digital piracy was filed by the media network and it is expected that more actors could likely be summoned in the case. It is important to note that the Fairplay app is a subsidiary app of the Mahadev Betting App, which is promoted by Sourabh Chandrakar and Ravi Uppal who are currently being probed by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) in a money laundering case. Mahadev Online betting application is said to be an umbrella syndicate that arranges online platforms for allegedly enabling illegal betting websites.

79,"30 October, 2023 ",Punjab govt to ban performing stunts on tractors after stuntman was mowed down at sports fair," A video that went viral on social media showed a man named Sukhmandeep Singh attempting to climb the wheel of a tractor that was running on the two rear wheels. While attempting to place his legs on the moving wheels, one of Singh's legs got trapped in the mud during which he was overrun by the tractor.The Punjab government is set to impose a ban on performing stunts on tractors. This comes two days after a 29-year-old man was killed on 28th October while trying to perform a stunt in Sarchur village in the Fatehpur Churiyan constituency.“Dear Punjabi tractor is called the king of fields..don’t make it the angel of death..any kind of stunt or dangerous performance with tractor and related implements is being banned in Punjab..rest details soon..,” Punjab CM Bhagwant Mann announced on social media platform X.A video that went viral on social media showed a man named Sukhmandeep Singh attempting to climb the wheel of a tractor that was running on the two rear wheels. While attempting to place his legs on the moving wheels, one of Singh’s legs got trapped in the mud during which he was overrun by the tractor.The incident occurred during a local mela in Gurdaspur. The crowd ran to Singh’s rescue and he was rushed to the hospital but was declared dead on arrival. The event organisers’ reportedly did not have permission to conduct the event.The deceased stuntman had performed several stunts during the Farmer protests too. “A private fair was organised. A tractor stuntman injured himself while trying to control a tractor. He lost his life on his way to the hospital. The organisers of such fairs only take permission for loudspeakers during the festive season,” Gurdaspur Deputy Commissioner Himanshu Aggarwal said.He added, “I have directed all the Sub Divisional Magistrates of the districts to give permission to such fairs only after a thorough check. I have asked them to take an undertaking that the stuntmen are professionals and have taken proper measures.”In August this year, a farmer lost his life and several policemen were injured during protests by farmers in the Longowal area of Sangrur after being overrun by a tractor.In 2021, during the Farmer protests, two protesting women died on the spot and three others were seriously injured after a tractor participating in the tractor rally ran over a group of women in Amritsar.The craze for tractor stunts runs wild in Punjab and is considered a symbol of wealth. Safe to say, it is now also symbolic of death on wheels.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds. In name of saving democracy, they get money from various sources.

According to the Geneva Conventions, it is the responsibility of the occupation to provide them with all services as long as they are under occupation.""The tunnels built inside Gaza are for the protection of Hamas operatives, and not civilians, said Hamas official Mousa Abu Marzouk when asked why Hamas wasn’t building bomb shelters within Gaza to save the residents from Israeli bombings. Marzouk further added that it was the responsibility of the UN and Israel to protect civilians living in Gaza.“Since you have built 500 kilometres of tunnels inside Gaza, why didn’t you build bomb shelters for citizens to take shelter during bombardments?” the interviewer asked Marzouk.To this, Marzouk responded: “We have built the tunnels because we have no other way of protecting ourselves from being targeted and killed. These tunnels are meant to protect us from aeroplanes.

81,"30 October, 2023 ",Did Pakistan Cricket Board release statement saying their Chairman stopped talking to Babar Azam after the captain tried to get in touch with his married daughter," Babar Azam's WhatsApp chats with PCB COO Salman Naseer were reportedly leaked online by the board president Zaka Ashraf on a live TV program.The dismal performance of the Pakistani cricket team in the ongoing Cricket World Cup has snowballed into an alleged discord between players and board members. However, the reports of the rift gained strength on Monday (30th October), when the purported private chat of Babar Azam was made public by a Pakistani news channel. His WhatsApp chats with PCB COO Salman Naseer were reportedly leaked online by the board president Zaka Ashraf on a live TV show.PCB Statement on Babar Azam's WhatsApp Chats:#BabarAzam | #CWC23 | #DattKePakistani pic.twitter.com/Ttu0xEpY6NSubsequently, netizens and Pakistani journalists began circulating a fake release from the PCB on social media which made bold claims against Babar Azam, Zaka Ashraf, and Salman Naseer.The viral release attributed to PCB claimed that “all WhatsApp communications between Babar Azam and PCB Chairman Zaka Ashraf or Mr. Salman has been suspended since the day Babar tried to contact their married daughters viz. Fiza Ashraf and Humaima Naseer.” It added, “PCB doesn’t associate itself with the media channel ARY NEWS and its journalists” after the purported WhatsApp chats were leaked on air by sports presenter Waseem Badami from ARY News.However, the PCB release circulating on social media is obviously a fake one as Captain Babar Azam and CEO Salman Naseer have clearly communicated during the ongoing World Cup, as evidenced by the chats leaked on the news channel.Conspicuously, the rumours stem from the fact that according to Pakistani media reports, PCB chief Ashraf has been ignoring Babar’s phone calls. Ex-Pakistan captain Rashid Latif on national TV alleged that PCB head Zaka Ashraf had been avoiding Babar Azam’s calls or messages. When Latif’s remarks started making headlines, a local Pakistani TV channel contacted Zaka Ashraf to clarify his position on the matter. Sharing light on the matter, Zaka said, “He [Latif] says that I don’t pick up his [Babar’s] call. Putting all rumours to rest, the PCB official clarified that the 29-year-old Pakistani skipper did not reach out to him directly. The PCB chief added, “He’s never given me a call. The chief operating officer (COO) or the director of international cricket is expected to speak with the captain of the team.” Afterwards, PCB’s COO Salman Naseer shared the WhatsApp chat between the two (him and Babar) on live TV.To substantiate his claim, Salman Naseer, on behalf of Zaka, during a live chat, allowed the interviewer to display their WhatsApp conversation.They leaked Babar Azam’s private WhatsApp chats? Pakistani players ko milta kya hai ko unse itni expectations rakhte ho? This is disgusting, he still has three matches to play in this World Cup pic.twitter.com/8eHSG2oygTIn the leaked chat, Naseer asked Babar, “Babar, there have been reports on TV and social media claiming that you tried contacting the Chairman, and he hasn’t responded. Did you recently attempt to reach out to him?’ To this, Babar replied, ‘Hello Salman bhai, I haven’t tried calling sir.” My humble thoughts on Babar Azam – Zaka Ashraf issue 🙏🙏🙏 pic.twitter.com/g7RwamSP54Regarding the source and authenticity of these purported chats, sports presenter Waseem Badami asserted that it was wrong on their part to air private chats of two individuals but they got carried away when Zaka himself pursued them to air the chats. Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

82,"30 October, 2023 ",Cricket World Cup 2023: Pakistan Chief Selector Inzamam-ul-Haq resigns amidst dismal performance of the team due to ‘conflict of interest’ in team selection," While the official reason given for Inzamam's resignation is the conflict of interest issue in team selection, one suspects Pakistan's poor performance at the World Cup is a part of it.The ongoing cricket World Cup in India is just past the halfway stage but it has already registered its first casualty as Pakistan Chief Selector Inzaman-ul-Haq has resigned from his post. The former Captain sent his resignation letter to Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chief Zaka Ashraf following Pakistan’s four-match losing streak in the World Cup.While the official reason given for Inzamam’s resignation is the conflict of interest issue in team selection, one suspects Pakistan’s poor performance at the World Cup is a part of it. Pakistan have lost 4 games against India, Australia, Afghanistan, and South Africa in the World Cup, after victories in the first two games against the Netherlands and Sri Lanka. They are now on the brink of elimination.Inzamam, whose nephew Imam-ul-Haq opens the batting for Pakistan, assumed the position of Chief Selector once again on 7th August. Earlier, he had served as Chief Selector of the Pakistan Cricket Team from 2016 to 2019 for over 3 years. While his earlier stint saw Pakistan win a coveted ICC trophy in the form of the 2017 Champions Trophy, now the team has plunged to very low depths during the ongoing World Cup.After winning their first two games, Pakistan has succumbed to four consecutive losses, including a humiliating defeat at the hands of arch-rivals India. The pressure due to those losses was mounting on everyone from the coach and captain to the selectors and it looks like the selectors were the first to buckle.While addressing the charges of conflict of interest in team selection, Inzamam-ul-Haq said, “I am a human and it hurts. I have a 20-year cricket career during which I represented Pakistan. I am not someone who people don’t know. When such allegations are levelled, it hurts.”Meanwhile, PCB posted on X (formerly Twitter) that it had formed a five-member fact-finding committee to investigate allegations in respect of conflict of interest.Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) has set up a five-member fact-finding committee to investigate allegations in respect of conflict of interest reported in the media pertaining to the team selection process.The committee will submit its report and any recommendations to the PCB…Inzamam-ul-Haq is one of the finest batsmen ever produced by Pakistan scoring 8,830 runs at an impressive average of 49.60 in Test matches and 11,739 runs in ODIs at an equally impressive average of 39.53.

An initial probe has revealed that Martin worked in Dubai as an electrician for about 15 years and returned to India only two months ago.Hours after multiple blasts rocked the Jehova’s Witness prayer meeting in Kochi, Kerala, a 48-year-old man named Dominic Martin claimed responsibility for the blasts on a live video on his Facebook account. The congregation was attended by nearly 2,000 people.Martin, 48, was also a member of the Jehova’s Witnesses faith, who consider themselves of the Christian faith. The accused surrendered on Sunday evening (29th October). At least three people have died in the blasts including a minor girl while more than 50 have been injured.Reports are now surfacing about Martin’s background even as the National Investigation Agency (NIA) will be probing the case. An initial probe has revealed that Martin worked in Dubai as an electrician for about 15 years and returned to India only two months ago.According to a report by Zee News, upon his return, Martin took the children’s tuition whereas India Today has claimed that he taught English to locals.He has two children, one of whom is reportedly abroad. People who came in Martin’s contact are also being investigated. The accused is reportedly said to be an expert in electric circuit making.Meanwhile, a report by NDTV quoting Martin’s neighbours claims that they described him as “nice”. The report claims that Dominic had been living in a rented accommodation for over five years.The house in which Martin resides is owned by a Jaleel, who reportedly recalled instances of his “gentle gestures, such as voluntarily increasing the rent by Rs 1000 without any request being made for that”.“He was such a person who hiked the rent by ₹ 1,000 himself and gave it to me without asking for it,” Jaleel said. Martin is a 10th class pass. His son is pursuing higher studies in the UK and his daughter is studying in Kochi.The ward councillor of the area, Sakkeer revealed that Martin had left the house early on 29th October and indicated to his wife his plan to visit a friend.“He had touched the feet of his wife and told her that he was going. Martin had told his wife the previous day that he would be leaving early on Sunday to meet a friend of his,” Sakkeer reportedly said.Jaleel said that the police conducted a forensic examination at Martin’s residence but no incriminating evidence was found.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

84,"30 October, 2023 ","Punjab: Police accuses man with 80% disability in lower limbs of high-speed escape, asked to pay Rs 1.5 lakhs by Punjab & Haryana High Court to accused"," The court found that the petitioner is wheelchair-bound owing to his disability and he was unable to even stand on his own, let alone walk or run.The Punjab and Haryana High Court has awarded legal costs to the tune of Rs 1.5 lakhs to a man suffering from 80% locomotion disability. The man was booked due to “mistaken identity” under the Punjab Excise Act, 1914, for allegedly fleeing with illicit liquor in his vehicle. Justice Arun Monga also mandated the police to carry out a comprehensive investigation into the case. The High Court has directed the State of Punjab to initially pay the litigation costs to the petitioner amounting to 1.5 lakhs. The court, however, noted that this would be later recovered from the erring police officials who would be found guilty after the conclusion of the inquiry by SSP, Pathankot.Justice Arun Monga said, “It is considered desirable that the petitioner, who has suffered unnecessarily at the hands of erring police officials and was forced into litigation first before learned Sessions Court and then before this Court, be awarded at least the litigation costs. Same are assessed at Rs.50,000/- for litigation before learned Court below and Rs.1,00,000/- for this Court, thus a total Rs.1,50,000/-.”The High Court added, “The same be paid from the State exchequer as of now, to be recovered subsequently from the erring police officials, subject to the outcome of the inquiry to be conducted by the Senior Superintendent of Police, Pathankot.” The High Court gave these directions while hearing the petitioner Kulwinder Singh’s plea. Apparently, in September 2023, he was named as one of the accused in the illicit liquor trade case under Sections 61, 78(2) of the Punjab Excise Act and Sections 420, 467, 468, and 471 read with 120B of the IPC.The prosecution alleged that Singh fled away from the scene when the police tried to catch him during a surprise check of the vehicle he was driving. According to them, they found a large amount of liquor, which violated the Punjab Excise Act, of 1914.However, the court found that the petitioner was incapable of driving any vehicle due to Post-Polio Residual Paralysis of lower limbs. It found that the petitioner is wheelchair-bound owing to his disability and he was unable to even stand on his own, let alone walk or run.According to the FIR, the other accused who were apprehended in this case revealed the name of the fleeing person as Kulwinder Singh, the petitioner. The Court noted that SHO Ms. Manjeet Kaur along with ASI Sartaj Singh were present in the Court and offered their unconditional apology for the faux pas that occurred in the case due to the mistaken identity of the petitioner.The state’s counsel submitted that the “false name of the petitioner” was given in the “disclosure statement of co-accused” Charanjit Singh, who was arrested on the spot. Apparently, this led to the petitioner being named as one of the prime accused in the FIR in this case. Regarding the apologies by SHO and ASI, Justice Monga remarked, “To say the least, their belated apology, at this stage seems to have been tendered to save themselves from the adverse consequences contemplated at the time of passing the order dated 05.10.2023, when the IO was very much present in this Court and said order was dictated in his presence.”The anticipatory bail petition was filed before the Sessions Court at Pathankot in September. Back then, the contents of the plea were completely known to the police officials. Highlighting this, the court observed that it was rather “unfathomable” that even then no attempt was made to verify with regard to the identity of the petitioner and/or his being 80% incapacitated and wheelchair-bound.The court noted, “On the contrary, a completely opposite stand was taken before the learned Sessions Court at the time of arguments.” The bench observed that on the same day, at 03:20 pm, during the pre-arrest bail hearing, ASI Sartaj Singh recorded a DDR. It stated that the petitioner was inadvertently named as the prime accused and, that he is actually innocent.The court asked, “Why the said DDR was not handed over to Sessions Court when the matter was being heard in Court on the very same day and, if the same was not possible, why the Court was not verbally informed that the petitioner had already been found innocent so as to render the anticipatory bail petition infructuous on that ground alone, instead of being dismissed on merits.”The court also directed that SSP shall conduct an administrative inquiry into the entire matter. The court directed that in case he finds the aforesaid statements of SHO/ASI made before this Court to be false, “then action be taken against the delinquent officials for deliberately making a false statement including the institution of appropriate proceedings.”The Court instructed that an inquiry report should be submitted before the Additional Sessions Judge (ASJ) who passed the order dismissing the anticipatory bail petition of the petitioner. It added that after considering the report, ASJ shall, “if deemed appropriate, take further steps to register a complaint under Section 195 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 against the delinquent police officials who have led to the whole melee.” Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

85,"30 October, 2023 ",Virat Kohli fans call for a boycott of Dainik Jagran after its reporter said Rohit Sharma does not care for centuries like Kohli," In an article written by journalist Abhishek Tripathi for Dainik Jagran, the author said Kohli focused on completing centuries while the Indian cricket team captain Rohit Sharma concentrated on giving India a flying start with his ruthless approach in decimating opponents. On Monday (30th October), the fans of Virat Kohli, an Indian international cricketer and the former captain of the Indian national cricket team, slammed the Dainik Jagran media for writing and printing articles comparing Kohli with Rohit Sharma on their differing approach to the game. Kohli fans called for a boycott of the Dainik Jagran media and burned their publication after it published an article on Kohli’s batting approach in the ongoing World Cup.In an article written by journalist Abhishek Tripathi for Dainik Jagran, the author slammed Kohli while praising Indian cricket team captain Rohit Sharma. In the article titled, ‘Shatak Par Ravaiyaa alag alag (two different point of views on century)’ the journalist stated that Kohli concentrated more on completing centuries. Meanwhile, he praised Rohit Sharma and said he played for the Indian team and concentrated more on big shots. India won 6 cricket matches back-to-back in the World Cup 2023 season heading towards the semi-finals. Every player’s performance under the leadership of Rohit Sharma has been nothing but spectacular. The Men in Blue have shown remarkable consistency by winning 6 one-day matches and securing their position in the semi-finals. However, the comparisons between former captain Virat Kohli and current team captain in all formats, Rohit Sharma have upset the Kohli fans. The Kohli fans on Monday, 30th October burned the Dainik Jagran newspaper and shared the videos on social media platforms trending the hashtag that called out Dainik Jagran. Virat Kohli fans burned Dainik Jagran newspapers because Dainik Jagran published articles against Virat Kohli.😂😭😂😭😂#BoycottDainikJagranpic.twitter.com/hpFu07oXJyNever mess with King 👑 and his fans. #BoycottDainikJagran pic.twitter.com/7nwGQAOGxoThis is how Dainik Jagran should be treated for writing against India's pride Virat Kohli#BoycottDainikJagran pic.twitter.com/2F5Xkl9ZR8Friendly reminder – Never mess with Mighty Virat Kohli fans#BoycottDainikjagran pic.twitter.com/7Q5f6l7nhXMy Aunt who is a huge Kohli fan sent me this picture 😭🤣#BoycottDainikjagran pic.twitter.com/2lUzgOllIdThe journalist wrote an account of Virat Kohli and his attempts to complete centuries during the six matches. He indicated that Kohli focussed on the century and played to complete 100 runs. While praising Rohit Sharma, journalist Abhishek Tripathi also alleged that Kohli did not play for India but had a personal interest in achieving his individual goals. The article published in Dainik Jagran irked the fans of Virat Kohli who also hurled abuses at the reporter from Kanpur and the media house. However, hours after Tripathi who is the sports editor at Dainik Jagran shared the article on X, he posted another sarcastic tweet targeting the fans of the cricketer. “Winter is coming, ‘fans’ are about to go off,” he tweeted. ठंड आ रही है, पंखे बंद होने वाले हैं…Earlier today, former Indian cricketer Gautam Gambhir also praised Rohit Sharma and indirectly targeted Virat Kohli over his centuries. “Rohit does not think of centuries. He plays selflessly. Thinking and strategies differ when one plays for India and when one plays for attaining centuries. Rohit plays for India. If he had thought about centuries, he would have made 40-45 centuries easily till date,” Gambhir was quoted as saying by Dainik Jagran. Kohli is largely recognized as one of the greatest batsmen in cricket history. The International Cricket Council honored him as the male cricketer of the decade in 2020. Kohli has also been instrumental in India’s success, captaining the team from 2014 to 2022 and lifting the World Cup in 2011 and the Champions Trophy in 2013. He is one of just four Indian cricketers who have played 500 matches for his country. Kohli is the fourth-highest run-scorer in international cricket and ranks second in terms of international hundreds scored.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

87,"30 October, 2023 ","Pro-Palestine mobilisation in Maharashtra: 2 protests in Mumbra, 200 booked, minor children made to act like dead bodies in Aurangabad"," ""This is highly condemnable. Making children act in such a horrific manner for their agenda is dangerous. NCPCR has taken cognizance of the matter and will soon issue a notice in this case,"" NCPCR's chairperson Priyank Kanoongo told OpIndia. On Sunday (29th October), hundreds of Muslims gathered in the Mumbra and Thane region of Maharashtra’s Mumbai district to extend support to Palestine amid the ongoing Israel-Hamas war. The protesters raised pro-Palestine slogans and also called to boycott the products being manufactured in Israel. According to the initial information obtained by OpIndia, the protest was called by a forum named ‘The United Milli Forum’. The members of the forum are said to have organized the protest rally against Israel under the guise of offering prayers for the Palestinians. As per the report by India Today, the organizers had asked for permission to conduct the rally but the same was denied by the Thane Police Commissionerate.

The protestors also raised slogans against Israel and called for a boycott of products emerging from Israel. The videos of the protests are going viral over the internet in which the pro-Palestine supporters could be seen gathered on the ground in the Mumbra region of Maharashtra. They could also be seen raising placards against Israel and offering prayers for Palestinians.

Earlier, similar protests were organized in the Aurangabad district and also the Thane district of Maharashtra. So, notably, this is the second protest that has been organized by Muslims in Thane in support of Palestine. The first protest was organized by the Social Democratic Party of India (SDPI) in the Mumbra area where hundreds had gathered extending support in solidarity with Palestine. However, the protests were illegally organized so the police had booked around 200 persons in the case. Police said that the protesters defied prohibitory orders in the city while staging support to Palestine.

Later the Police happened to identify 16 persons but no arrests were made. The protesters carried banners and raised slogans against Israel in the city. As per the official, they shouted slogans in support of Palestine and defied the prohibitory orders in force in the Commissionerate.Similar protests were organized by the Students Islamic Organisation which is the student wing of Jamat-e-Islami Hind on 28th October in Aurangabad city of Maharashtra. The protests were organized at the Aam Khas ground where the Islamists raised the Palestine flags and also raised slogans against Israel.A huge crowd gathered in #Aurangabad on the call of SIO @sioindia to show Solidarity with the people of palestine and stand against the apartheid State of Israel and it's allies. #28thOct @siomsz #Maharashtra#IsraelTerorrist #HamasMassacre #IsraelAttack #PalestineGenocide pic.twitter.com/up34Dyp5ArThe General Secretary of SIO, Salman Mobin Khan; National Secretary of Jamaat-e-Islami Hind, KK Suhail, and Aetesam Hami, the Zonal President of SIO South Maharashtra addressed the gathering. The gatherers meanwhile called the Israelis ‘murderers’ and prayed for the safety of the people in Gaza. The videos of these protests also went viral over the internet in which the children were used to display ‘dead bodies’. As per the videos, the children were made to act like dead bodies and were presented as kids of Gaza by the organizers. Some kids could be seen wrapped in white clothes while others were painted in red colour to depict blood stains.

The NCPCR said that children being misused by the organizers in such a horrific manner is not at all okay and that immediate action will be taken against the organizers. “This is highly condemnable. Making children act in such a horrific manner for their agenda is dangerous. NCPCR has taken cognizance of the matter and will soon issue a notice in this case,” NCPCR’s chairperson Priyank Kanoongo told OpIndia. So far, three pro-Palestine protests have been organized in the state of Maharashtra and it is said that many more such protests are scheduled to happen here in the state. OpIndia talked exclusively to BJP’s Pratik Karpe from Maharashtra to learn that a similar pro-Palestine protest was scheduled to be organized by Islamists in the Marine Drive area of Maharahtra’s Mumbai. However, the protest was not given permission as directed by Dy CM Devendra Fadnavis. “Who are these people who are issuing support to Palestine when our Prime Minister himself has stated that India stands with humanity and with Israel? These protests seem to be politically motivated and somebody is deliberately sponsoring these protests. Maybe for votes. We have seen people from other political parties supporting terrorists earlier. One NCP leader had supported terrorist Ishrat Jahan. Also, they openly supported Palestine even after Hamas launched a deadly attack on Israel.”“Dy CM Devendra Fadnavis took cognizance of such protests and restricted one such event that was scheduled to happen in Mumbai. His office proactively looked into the matter and didn’t allow the protest to happen. The one that happened in Thane and Mumbra seems to be sponsored and politically motivated,” Karpe said. It is important to note that NCP leader Jitendra Awhad on 19th October had called out BJP and PM Modi for extending support to Israel. In a tweet, he said that Israel had become a human rights violator and that it didn’t deserve to be supported. He also justified the Hamas attack on Israel by saying that “the number of casualties of Israel’s army is far less than what Palestine has suffered.” Lack of factual knowledge is the biggest syndrome of BJP supporters in India. There's a total absence of the desire to learn as well. Their campaign _l support Israel_ is the major manifestation of this imbecility without knowing the history of Israel.India has always been in…The opposition parties in India also recently targeted the BJP-led government for not taking a clear stand on the Israel-Hamas war at the United Nations. This is after India abstained from voting for the Jordanian-drafted resolution that failed to condemn the terrorist attacks by Hamas. It, however, voted in favor of a Canada-led amendment to the draft resolution on the Gaza crisis which has sought to insert a paragraph condemning the ‘terrorist attacks by Hamas. While it is understandable for opposition parties to criticize the government and its officials, politicizing critical geopolitical matters for political gain is a sheer travesty. The fact is that India has been clear on its stance on the Israel-Hamas conflict. India has condemned the terror attack launched by the Palestine-backed Hamas against Israel and emphasized its commitment to diplomacy and dialogue over violence. India has made it sufficiently clear that it will never side with terrorism.It is important to note that the Hamas terrorists launched a brutal attack on the Jewish state on 7th October killing around 1400 Israelis and injuring several others. The terrorists raped the Israeli women and also didn’t spare the elders and the children. The videos of these horrific incidents were also made viral. The attack on Israel by the Hamas terrorists marks the most brutal attack against Jews after the Holocaust.After the attack by Hamas, Israel launched a counter-attack on Gaza. Over 5,000 Palestinians have been killed so far, including women and children as well as journalists, medical workers, and first responders, with more than 15,000 injured. IDF has been asking Gazans to move away from Northern Gaza but Egypt has closed the Rafah crossing and has declared that it won’t allow any refugees from Gaza.

88,"30 October, 2023 ",Hindu man acquitted in 2020 Delhi riots case: What the court said about the unreliable testimony of the complainant and two police witnesses," Based on this lack of evidence, Sandeep Kumar, who was charged under sections 147/148/427/436/ 380/506/454 IPC read with Section 149 IPC and pled not guilty to all charges, was acquitted. On the 27th of October, the court acquitted a Hindu man of all charges in a 2020 Delhi anti-Hindu riots case. The charges against Sandeep Kumar included those of arson, vandalism and loot. Additional Sessions Judge (ASJ) Pulastya Pramachala of Karkardooma Court said that the prosecution had failed to prove its case and the testimony of the witnesses by the prosecution was unreliable. While discharging Sandeep Kumar, the court said that the prosecution had proved that the complainants house was vandalised and burnt down, however, they failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that it was the work of a mob and that Sandeep Kumar was a part of the mob which allegedly carried out the arson and loot. The prosecution had alleged that the house of one Rashid was burnt down by a Hindu mob, of which, Sandeep Kumar was a part. It was alleged that Kumar was a part of an unlawful assembly responsible for the looting of a residence and the ignition of household items and a two-wheeler in the Shiv Vihar locality within Karwal Nagar on February 25, 2020.In the judgment dated October 27, ASJ Pramachala remarked, “The prosecution, although it successfully presented evidence of vandalism, looting, and the destruction of household items and a motorcycle, could not conclusively demonstrate the mob’s responsibility for these actions or the defendant’s unequivocal involvement in said mob.”Delivering its verdict, the court said that the testimony of the complainant, Rashid, was not helpful since he was not present when his house was vandalised and burnt down. The court said, “He came back to his house after 3-4 days from 25-02-2020 and at that time he found his motor-cycle in completely burnt condition. He also found his articles on the first floor of the house in vandalized and burnt condition. He also alleged that jewelries of his wife were missing. So, even if it is accepted that his house was vandalized and jewelries were looted, still it is not established from the evidence of PW3 that a mob was behind this incident. In the complaint of PW3, it is mentioned that a mob did this, but apparently such plea was not based on personal knowledge of PW3”. The court further said the two policemen, who had claimed that they were present at the very spot and witnessed not just the mob but also Sandeep Kumar as a part of the mob, were not reliable in their testimony. One of the policemen, PW5, did not make any mention of the specific incident of vandalism but had only made a general statement that he had witnessed a mob at Gali No. 11. “He made a general statement that he saw a mob of 30- 40 persons in gali no. 11 at about 7 PM, while indulging in vandalism and arson. He projected himself to be a chance witness, stating that he was going to police station when he saw this mob. On the other hand, PW6 deposed that he reached gali 11 on receiving information from public about assembly of a mob in this gali. According to PW6, this information was received by him at Shiv Vihar Tiraha and at that time no other police official was present there. He stated that he reached gali 11 in about 3 minutes and it was around 7 PM when he was in this gali and when he saw a mob of around 30-40 persons”, the court said. The court then noted the discrepancies in the statements of the two police officers. On the basis of the discrepancies, the court raised doubt that both the police officers were even present at Gali No 11, as they stated. Additionally, the court noted that while one of the police officials had recorded his statement identifying Kumar on February 29, the other officer claimed to have seen the accused only on August 1, 2020. This inconsistency further undermined the reliability of their testimonies.Based on this lack of evidence, Sandeep Kumar, who was charged under sections 147/148/427/436/ 380/506/454 IPC read with Section 149 IPC and pled not guilty to all charges, was acquitted. On the 24th and 25th of February 2020, India’s national capital Delhi saw large-scale anti-Hindu riots which marked the culmination of the hostility, hatred, and anger spread by the anti-CAA protests by the Islamists in Shaheen Bagh and other areas. Shahdara, Maujpur, Bhajanpura, Brahmapuri, and other parts of northeast Delhi witnessed violence perpetrated by the Islamists. 53 people died in these riots while more than 200 people were left injured.While many people wish to look at the Delhi Riots 2020 in isolation, the sequence of events starting right from the 1st of December 2019 proves otherwise. It proves that the violence was a concerted effort to push India toward anarchy. It proves that the Delhi Riots was no anti-Muslim pogrom, it was indeed, a well-oiled plan against Hindus.OpIndia had extensively covered the anti-Hindu riots, which were falsely presented by the mainstream media as an anti-Muslim pogrom, and established facts documenting tragic cries of Hindus which would otherwise have gone unheard.The damage to the property in these riots had been enormous. An Intelligence Bureau Constable was murdered in the riots along with a Head Constable of the Delhi Police. Amidst all of this, one gun-wielding man was spotted brandishing his gun at the Police and firing shots. The rioter was identified as Shahrukh. A Hindu man Dilbar Negi was burnt to death after his hands and legs were chopped off by Jihadis. Delhi was in the grip of communal violence ever since the passage of the Citizenship Amendment Act. What Delhi saw in these anti-Hindu riots was only the crescendo of a fire that was lit by radicals months ago.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

Among one such disturbing visual was the naked and battered dead body of an unidentified woman who was being paraded by the Hamas terrorists in a pickup truck. The gruesome video showed terrorists shouting the Islamic slogan ‘Allah Hu Akbar’ while the partially naked body of a woman, later identified as Shani Louk, being paraded in a pickup truck. In some videos that surfaced on social media, a murderous crowd of Hamas terrorists could be seen surrounding the vehicle, chanting slogans and spitting on the woman’s body.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

90,"30 October, 2023 ","‘Da*y*n, wh*re, pa*eet’: After the death of social media influencer Smokingskills, Islamists abuse his fiance online"," Several Islamists and leftists on X mocked Yash's fiance and her Hindu faith by insinuating that she would perform Sati while grieving her fiance's death.On 29th October, a young social media rightwing influencer who was famous by the handle ‘SmokingSkills07’ on X (formerly Twitter) passed away due to a heart ailment. Yash, the person behind the handle, was not even 30 years old. The demise of the famous influencer came as a shock to several sane and sensible netizens on X. While many people on social media mourned Yash’s death, Islamists and liberals like RLD leader Prashant Kanojia and out-on-bail fake news paddler Mohammed Zubair of dubious portal Alt News mocked and celebrated the death of this young man. Then there were a few more Islamists who stooped lower still. In their hatred for the young right-wing activist and influencer, these insensitive and rude individuals went so far as to abuse and harass his fiance online.Amidst this sorrowful circumstance, an Islamist who goes by the handle @Apkabhai009 could not persist in his abusive action and went on to not only mock the death of the young social media rightwing influencer @SmokingSkills07 but also went on to abuse his fiance saying that she would keep crying while her hubby is being “cooked in hell right now.” He shamelessly wished that she too died soon like her fiance.In this time of loss, any normal person would send condolence messages to the deceased’s family and loved ones, but instead, these vile Islamists tagged his fiance and used extremely crude and abusive slang against her while celebrating the death of the young X user. @minoritywatch1 superimposed X user Mr Sinha’s tweet announcing Yash’s demise on his post where it shared a picture of a pig. Then, by shamelessly equating the deceased social media influencer to a pig, @minoritywatch1 went on to abuse and wish death upon Yash’s fiance.Several Islamists and leftists on X mocked Yash’s fiance and her Hindu faith by insinuating that she would perform Sati while grieving her fiance’s death.Islamists shamelessly went on to quote a sarcastic quote by Yash’s fiance to poke fun at her on the demise of the right-wing influencer.Earlier, Opindia reported how RLD leader Prashant Kanojia and out-on-bail fake news paddler Mohammed Zubair of dubious portal Alt News mocked the untimely death of their ideological nemesis. In now-deleted posts, Zubair first quoted a sarcastic tweet of Yash to mock his death and deleted it. Then he quoted another post of Yash where he alleged that Zubair was giving backend support to terrorists and wrote, “RIP smokingskills07”. The second post was deleted as well.Similarly, in a post in Hindi on X, Kanojia shared some screenshots of Yash’s social media posts and said, “[The] Person who pretended to protect religion has died. Was enjoying the dead bodies of children, today nature enjoyed. My condolences to the family and hope their son goes to hell and his soul continues to wander in Gaza. Happy death to oblivion!”Several leftists and Islamists exhibited an unparalleled lack of morality today when they descended on X to celebrate the right-wing influencer’s murder, but this group of Islamists did not even spare his fiance in this hour of grief. This merely shows that these groups of leftists and Islamists are willing to go to any length to malign people whose ideas differ from theirs or who dare to speak out their lies and hypocrisy.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

92,"30 October, 2023 ",‘Drowning!’ 911 dispatch call details from Matthew Perry’s residence released," According to media reports, he died shortly after returning to his Los Angeles home after a two-hour pickleball game.A day after the tragic demise of F.R.I.E.N.D.S.-fame actor Matthew Perry, the details of the 911 call that was made from his home on the fateful night has been released. In the dispatch audio obtained by TMZ, a man can be heard saying the word “drowning.” In the 15-second clip, a man remarks, “Agent 23. Rescue 23. EMS 9 on the radio. In response to the drowning.” However, some words were beeped out.Notably, veteran Hollywood actor Matthew Perry aka Chandler Bing died at the age of 54 on 29th October. At around 4 PM, he was found dead in his Los Angeles residence, in a jacuzzi. According to initial media reports, he died due to drowning. No drugs were found at the location and no foul play was suspected in connection with his demise, media reported. A Sokesperson of Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) stated that officers responded to a call at Perry’s residence regarding the death of a male who was in his 50s, however, they didn’t confirm the identity of the deceased at that time.According to media reports, he died shortly after returning to his Los Angeles home after a two-hour pickleball game. He had sent his assistant on an errand, and when they returned approximately two hours later, they discovered him unresponsive in the jacuzzi. They immediately called police for emergency assistance, as per TMZ. The cause of Matthew Perry’s death still remains unknown after an inconclusive autopsy report. Regarding this, the Medical Examiner Office of the Los Angeles County said that toxicology tests are still pending to determine the exact cause and manner of death.In their first response to his tragic demise, Perry’s family told news outlet PEOPLE that they are “heartbroken” by his “tragic” death.They said, “We are heartbroken by the tragic loss of our beloved son and brother. Matthew brought so much joy to the world, both as an actor and a friend. You all meant so much to him and we appreciate the tremendous outpouring of love.” After his demise, the producer of hit sitcom F.R.I.E.N.D.S., Warner Bros. TV, released a statement remembering Matthew Perry as a dear friend. It said, “We are devastated by the passing of our dear friend Matthew Perry. Matthew was an incredibly gifted actor and an indelible part of the Warner Bros. Television Group family. The impact of his comedic genius was felt around the world, and his legacy will live on in the hearts of so many. This is a heartbreaking day, and we send our love to his family, his loved ones, and all of his devoted fans.”Throughout his life, Perry battled addiction, and he later shared his path to recovery. In October 2022, he disclosed that his increasing drug addiction had nearly claimed his life at the age of 49, as he spent two weeks in a coma, fighting for survival. Subsequently, he endured a five-month hospital stay and relied on a colostomy bag for a year after his colon suffered damage due to opioid overuse.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

93,"30 October, 2023 ","Dominic Martin, who took responsibility for Kerala blast, accuses Jehova’s Witness’ of having ‘anti-national beliefs’ which incidentally match radical Islam"," Martin reportedly said that Jehova's Witnesses ask the children not to sing the national anthem or join the defence services. ""They reach that all people of the world will perish and only they will live. What should we do with the people who long for the ruin of the entire people in the world? I could not find a solution,"" Martin said.The death toll rose to three in the Kerala blasts that rocked the prayer convention of Jehova’s Witnesses in Kochi, Kerala on 29th October after a 12-year-old girl succumbed to burn injuries during treatment.The girl, a resident of Ernakulam district, had suffered 95 per cent burns and was on ventilator support. Two other women, Leona (55), and Kumari (53) are among the deceased. More than 50 people have been injured in the blasts at the Zamra International Convention and Exhibition Centre at Kalamassery.Hours after the blasts, a man named Dominic Martin surrendered to the police claiming responsibility for the explosions. Before his arrest, Martin, a former member of Jehova’s Witness, appeared live on a social media platform and said that he believed that its teachings were “anti-national and seditious”.“Their teaching is not right. They are teaching anti-national things. I told them that they should change their ways. Staying in a…but cursing and addressing people in that country in the worst…derogatory form is they do. They are telling a 4-year-old child that if somebody from another community gives you candy, you shouldn’t have it. From an early age, they are feeding such poison into the child,” the accused reportedly alleged.He further said, “I took this decision because I understood that this organisation is bad for the country. Political parties won’t take action because everyone is scared of religion. You should open your eyes.”The Indian Express quoted Martin saying that Jehova’s Witnesses ask the children not to sing the national anthem or join the defence services. “They reach that all people of the world will perish and only they will live. What should we do with the people who long for the ruin of the entire people in the world? I could not find a solution,” Martin said.Jehova’s Witnesses, according to information available on their website jw.org, “strive to adhere to the form of Christianity that Jesus taught and that is apostles practised”. They consider Jehova as the one true and Almighty God, the Creator, who is the God of Abraham, Moses, and Jesus.According to information on jw.org, Jehova’s Witnesses do not participate in nationalistic ceremonies. “Jehova’s Witnesses choose not to participate in such ceremonies because we believe that these conflict with Bible teachings. We appreciate receiving the same respect for our beliefs as we show to others who make a different choice,” the official website of Jehova’s Witnesses reads. The group claims to remain “strictly neutral” in political affairs and “avoid affiliation with other religions”. Interestingly, a lot of these beliefs bear a resemblance to Islam in more than one way primarily owing to their Abrahamic origins.Islam and Jehova’s Witness, both propagate religion above nationalism making religious identity the unifying aspect of the community and not the country. This has been reflected in some incidents pertaining to the same.In 1986, three children belonging to the Jehova’s Witness sect refused to sing the National Anthem in their school in Kerala citing their beliefs. The children – Bijoe Emmanuel, Binu, and Bindu – were expelled from the Nair Service Society High School.However, the Supreme Court later held that forcing them to sing the National Anthem was a violation of their fundamental right to religion under Article 25 of the Indian Constitution.Similarly, a Muslim cleric forbade the students of a madrasa in UP’s Maharajganj from singing the national anthem on Independence Day in 2018. In a video that went viral on social media, the cleric was heard telling the students to avoid singing the national anthem because it is not “jayaz” (permissible) in Islam.The Uttar Pradesh government derecognised the madrasa and the UP Madrasa Board released immediate orders to suspend its licence and registration.According to al-islam.org, “the Quran has explicitly rejected the basis of nationalism”. It says, “To nationalism what matters the most is loyalty and attachment to the homeland, whereas to Islam, it is God and religion. Islam wishes all nations to regard the Quran as their Book, and the Ka’aba as their Qibla, and true leaders of Islam as their leaders.”The same is reflected in historical events like India’s partition in 1947, which was based on religious grounds to form a purely “Islamic nation”. The idea of the Muslim Brotherhood, which emanated from the Middle East, and has been the foundation of several terrorist organisations in the region also is a key example.Joining the armed forces of one’s homeland is also prohibited in both religions. Jehova’s Witnesses believe that “God alone deserves our worship”. Pledging allegiance to any symbol of nationalism is prohibited. “Jehovah’s Witnesses likewise feel that saluting the flag amounts to an act of worship, or idolatry, which the Bible prohibits,” the Jehova’s Witnesses state.Last year, a 24-year-old former Muslim cleric from Kerala revealed that Indian Muslims are taught to not join the Indian Army. During a press conference, Askar Ali said, “We were taught to hate other communities and not to join the Indian army as we will have to kill our own community members which is against our religious principles.”Jehova’s Witnesses, who consider themselves of the Christian faith, are also known to indulge in conversion practices, a practice vehemently followed in Islam, too. “People may face new problems or situations that they must deal with, moving them to take an interest in the Bible’s message. So we endeavour to talk to people on more than one occasion,” a statement on the website of Jehova’s Witnesses reads.Islam too openly preaches and practices conversion, stemming from Islamic concepts like Dar-ul-Islam. Several criminal incidents have taken place with the accused often attempting to convert the victim. This includes several recurring cases of love jihad or grooming jihad.Both Islam and Jehova’s Witnesses propagate that their respective gods do not approve of any other god and by extension, any other religion.Jehova’s Witness website says, “No, all religions are not the same. The Bible contains many examples of religions that displease God. These fall into two basic categories. Category 1: Worshipping false gods. Category 2: Worshipping the true God in a way he does not approve.”In fact, one of the reasons that they do not celebrate Christmas is because they believe it is “rooted in pagan traditions and rites”.Islam too fundamentally believes that there is no other god but Allah and that those who follow any other god than Allah and any other religion than Islam are “kafirs”.“Kafirs” means those who indulge in “kufr”. According to New Age Islam, an Islamic reformist organization, “The word Kufr means to reject faith in God, God’s signs, the prophets, the Holy Scriptures and the Day of Judgment. One who does not have faith in the unity of God and does not have faith also in other sacred signs of God is a Kafir, according to the Quran. One who rejects faith in God or does not have faith in God is called a Kafir. A Kafir may also be an idolater who worships gods and goddesses. According to the Quran, they are those who have gone astray. There are about 350 verses about Kufr and Kafir.”It adds, “In the majority of the verses, Kufr is non-belief in one God and prophets of God and in Holy Scriptures. Kufr is also worship of idols and gods and goddesses other than God. In some of the verses, the word Kufr and its variations are used to mean ingratitude for the favours of God. It is natural that if someone does not recognize God or does not have faith in God, he will also not acknowledge God’s favours but will attribute the favours to his gods and goddesses.”In May 2021, a petition was filed before the Madras High Court seeking protection for Hindu processions which were dubbed as “sins” by some local Muslims in the Perambalur district in Tamil Nadu. Several such Hindu processions have come under attack by Islamists with the most recent one being in Nuh in Haryana’s Mewat where at least five Hindus were butchered and several others injured.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

94,"30 October, 2023 ","Human error likely again in the Vizianagaram train tragedy as it was in Balasore, here is what is known so far"," Going by how the accident occurred, it was the result of human error, as the loco pilot of the Visakhapatnam-Rayagada train ignored the signal and continued to run on the trackOn 29th October, two passenger trains collided in the district Vizianagaram of Andhra Pradesh, leading to the death of at least 13 passengers. Several passengers were reported injured in the accident. The Vizianagaram train accident, which reminded me of the tragic accident of Balasore in June 2023, possibly happened due to human error.Though the Ministry of Railways has released no official statement over the cause of the accident, a report in Times of India suggested that ‘human error’ could be the reason behind the tragedy. The paper cited sources in the Indian Railway saying the accident appeared to have been caused by an overshooting of the signal by the Visakhapatnam-Rayagada passenger train.According to a report in The Hindu, the accident took place when the Visakhapatnam-Palasa was running on the middle line and it had stopped as an overhead cable broke. The Visakhapatnam-Rayagada Express was coming from behind on the same line and rammed into the stationary train, resulting in the derailing of two coaches.Therefore, going by how the accident occurred, it was the result of human error, as the loco pilot of the Visakhapatnam-Rayagada train ignored the signal and continued to run on the track, hitting the other train on its rear end.According to senior government official Nagalakshmi S, there were 90 people in the two coaches that were derailed.India is implementing an anti-collision system for the Indian Railways to avoid accidents. The Kavach system uses high-frequency radio signals to communicate with nearby trains and tracks. It is a set of electronic devices and Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) devices installed in locomotives, in the signalling system and in the tracks.Apart from preventing head-on and rear-end collisions between trains on the same train, it can also slow down over-speeding trains, alert and apply brakes when a train crosses the signal, automatically whistle at level crossings, etc. The devices in the system connect to each other to control the brakes of the trains and alert the drivers based on the logic programmed into the system.It is important to understand that Kavach can work in both cases where there is a possible head-on collision or a collision from the rear end. The system works when both the trains are running, or when a train is stationary on a track and another train runs towards it on the same track.While under development for a decade, work on it started in 2012, but the system is yet to be installed on the entire network. It is a vast system, which needs to be installed on every train, every railway station, and every signalling point. The indigenously developed anti-collision system has been implemented in the railway network only recently. The trial of the Kavach system took place just a year ago, where two trains, one with Railway Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw, were driven towards each other on the same track, and the system successfully applied brakes to stop the trains in May last year. After that, the railways started installing the safety system in a phased manner. According to a statement by the ministry issued in December 2022, Kavach has been deployed for 1,455 Route Kms on the South Central Railway with 77 locomotives. The length of the railway routes across the country is 68,000km. This means that nearly 99% of the routes are still to be covered under the system. It is being installed on around 3000 km of track on the Delhi-Mumbai and Delhi–Howrah corridors. The Railways has informed that Kavach works have been sanctioned on 36,545 km routes. Apart from the Delhi-Mumbai & Delhi–Howrah corridors, work is also going on in train routes in West Bengal, Jharkhand, Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Delhi, Haryana, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat and Maharashtra.There are criticisms that the Railways is taking only small sections for Kavach implementation each year, and budget allocation is less. It is expected the Railway Board will accelerate the process following two back-to-back accidents involving the collision of two passenger trains. After the tragic Balasore accident, the Congress Party targeted the Modi government for allegedly misusing funds designated for railway safety. Citing a Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) report, Congress pointed out that the money was spent on items like foot massagers, crockery, and furniture from the Rashtriya Rail Sanraksha Kosh (RRSK). For the unaware, RRSK is a dedicated fund for railway safety. However, Congress had misrepresented the CAG report.The items mentioned in the report were purchased for Running Rooms. These rooms provide essential rest facilities for train crews between shifts. It has to be pointed out that Loco pilots and train managers need proper rest to ensure safety, as fatigue can lead to human errors, which have caused past accidents. The funds allocated for these items were minimal compared to the overall RRSK fund, and they were within the guidelines for staff welfare and passenger amenities under RRSK.However, two accidents in just a span of six months showed that there is a need for better-trained loco pilots and train managers to take quick measures to avoid accidents.On 2nd June 2023, 296 people died, and over 1,200 were injured in the tragic accident at Bahanaga Bazar station in Balasore, Odisha. On the day of the accidents, the Coromandel Express crashed into a stationary freight train. As a result of the Balasore Train Accident, some of the derailed coaches fell onto the adjacent tracks. A few minutes later, the Yeshwantpur-Howrah Express train came on those tracks and collided with the derailed coaches.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

The Islamists and leftists always had a weak sense of morality. But their utter lack of moral foundation was on display on Sunday when they mocked and celebrated the death of a social media user whose views did not align with the Left’s outlook and who had been at the vanguard in exposing the propaganda peddled by Islamists and left-liberals. Frontrunners of the abusers included RLD leader Prashant Kanojia and out-on-bail fake news paddler Mohammed Zubair of dubious portal Alt News, who mocked the untimely death of their ideological nemesis.In a post in Hindi on X, Kanojia shared some screenshots of Yash’s social media posts and said, “[The] Person who pretended to protect religion has died. Was enjoying the dead bodies of children, today nature enjoyed. My condolences to the family and hope their son goes to hell and his soul continues to wander in Gaza. Happy death to oblivion!”In now-deleted posts, Zubair first quoted a sarcastic tweet of Yash to mock his death and deleted it. Then he quoted another post of Yash where he alleged that Zubair was giving backend support to terrorists and wrote, “RIP smokingskills07”. The second post was deleted as well.Khoon me hi iske Zehar hai. Don’t delete your tweets Zubair.

He often puts a target behind their backs, unleashing the army of Sar Tan Se Juda fanatics, who go on a rampage causing law and order problems. Not to forget, he was the one who shared an edited video of a debate where former BJP spokesperson Nupur Sharma had quoted Islamic text in retaliation to Islamist panellist Taslim Rehmani during a debate on Times Now. His actions led to riots across the country and the death of Hindus, including a tailor from Udaipur and Umesh Kohle from Amrawati, as they had posted in support of Sharma. The venomous and crass commentsthat followed the death of the social media user, nevertheless, reflects not only the moral bankruptcy of the Left, but it also reveals their lack of humanity and macabre fascination to celebrate their opponent’s death and wish ill on the departed soul.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

97,"30 October, 2023 ",8 lakh industry workers in Tamil Nadu’s Sivakasi staring at unemployment due to ban on firecrackers by Delhi and other govts," According to industry players, the blanket ban on firecrackers imposed by the Delhi government has alone led to a 20 per cent demand shortage for Sivakasi manufacturers.Tamil Nadu’s Sivakasi city is known as the “fireworks capital” of India. The 90-year-old firecracker industry in this small town remains the producer of 90 per cent of India’s firecrackers. Sivakasi has 8,000 firecracker factories which employ around 8 lakh people. These eight lakh workers in Sivakasi, Tamil Nadu, who rely on the industry and its affiliated sectors, face a gloomy future this year since Delhi has imposed a blanket ban on firecrackers until January 1. Similarly, the government’s refusal to award sales licenses in Karnataka and limitations in the Noida region is harming the business of firecracker manufacturers in Tamil Nadu’s Sivakasi town.According to industry players, the blanket ban on firecrackers imposed by the Delhi government has alone led to a 20 per cent demand shortage for Sivakasi manufacturers. “We are now only producing green firecrackers without using barium nitrate. The ban in Delhi itself has led to a 20 per cent demand shortage for Sivakasi manufacturers,” T Kannan, general secretary of The Indian Fireworks Manufacturers Association (TIFMA) said.It may be recalled that on September 13, the Supreme Court declared that it wouldn’t interfere in the ban on the production, sale, storage, and utilization of all types of firecrackers in Delhi during this Diwali season. The ban has been re-imposed by the Delhi government.A bench comprised of Justices AS Bopanna and MM Sundresh indicated that some different ways to celebrate Deiwali should be adopted. This is after BJP Lok Sabha MP Manoj Tiwari stated before the court that the ban had been re-imposed despite the court allowing the bursting of green firecrackers.“There are many states imposing complete ban despite the orders of this court,” counsel representing Tiwari argued. The court responded to this by saying, “Locally if there is a ban, there is a ban. We will not interfere. You can find other ways to celebrate.”The SC decision came after the Delhi government, on September 11, declared a full ban on the manufacture, storage, sale, and bursting of firecrackers in the national capital to tackle high pollution levels during the winter months.During the previous two years, a similar blanket restriction had been imposed by the Delhi government. The issue of a ban on firecrackers appears every year ahead of Diwali, blaming the Hindu festival for the grave air pollution faced by Delhi and neighbouring areas during the fall season. Every year Diwali is targeted despite studies showing that the festival’s contribution to air pollution is negligible and temporary, while the major causes are stubble burning by farmers in nearby states, vehicles and construction activities, weather patterns, and the geographical location of the area.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

Kirti Singh, a first-year engineering student at ABES Engineering College, was in an auto-rickshaw on her way to a bus stop to take a bus to Hapur. Two bike-borne men, now identified as Balbir and Jeetu, followed the auto-rickshaw and attempted to snatch Kirti's phone.On Monday (30th October), the Uttar Pradesh Police during an encounter killed an accused who was wanted in a robbery and murder case of a college-going girl in Ghaziabad.

The other accused person who has attained injuries during the earlier encounter has been identified as Balbir. One of the police officers has also suffered injuries during the encounter. He has been admitted to the hospital and is undergoing treatment.

Update : गाजियाबाद में एनकाउंटर, लुटेरा जितेंद्र उर्फ जीतू मारा गया। इसने बीटेक छात्रा कीर्ति सिंह से मोबाइल लूटा था। इस वजह से वो ऑटो से गिरी और मौत हो गई। दूसरा लुटेरा बलवीर जेल जा चुका है। 3 इंस्पेक्टर हटाए जा चुके हैं। #Ghaziabad #Up https://t.co/5fD6stQKACThe incident occurred on Friday (27th October). Kirti Singh, a first-year engineering student at ABES Engineering College, was in an auto-rickshaw on her way to a bus stop to take a bus to Hapur. Two bike-borne men, now identified as Balbir and Jeetu, followed the auto-rickshaw and attempted to snatch Kirti’s phone. She tried to resist the robbery and fell from the moving auto-rickshaw resulting in severe head injuries. She was taken to a nearby hospital, where she died on Sunday, October 29th, while receiving treatment.Following an encounter, police nabbed the primary offender, Bobbil alias Balbir in an earlier encounter. During the gunfight, Balbir was hit in the leg. Jitendra, his partner who was on the motorbike, had managed to flee the scene. On Monday morning, Jeetu engaged in attacking police personnel while they tried to arrest him. In retaliatory fire, Jeetendra alias Jeetu was shot dead.“The first-year BTech computer science student at ABES Engineering College in Ghaziabad was admitted to the Neuro ICU of Yashoda Hospital in Nehru Nagar, where she was on ventilator support after sustaining head injuries,” the Police said. After the incident, the Police Commissioner of Ghaziabad, Ajay Kumar Mishra ordered the removal of the SHO of Masuri Police Station, Ravindran Pant. The new SHO appointed instead took cognizance of the event and said that sections of murder would now be added to the FIR filed against the accused. The police have meanwhile recovered an illegal pistol, Kirti’s mobile phone, and cartridges from Balbir. The family of the victim girl is in shock. Ankit Singh, Kirti’s brother commented on the issue and suspected that the girl might be killed for some other probable reasons. “I cannot understand why someone would do this to snatch just a phone. It was an old Samsung phone worth around Rs 8,000 – Rs 10,000. How can one kill someone for such a small amount?” he was quoted as saying. Ankit stated that it was Kirti’s dream to pursue computer science engineering at a reputable college. She had taken a year off to leave Hapur and enroll in a private institution.“We could have got Kirti admitted to any college in Hapur. But we liked the college in Ghaziabad and my sister always wanted to do engineering. She wanted to pursue M.Tech in the future and that’s why she took admission here,” he said.Kirti’s family was overjoyed when she got admitted into a course of her choice at the engineering college a few months ago. The distance between the college and her home, however, was an issue and Kirti was considering moving closer to the campus soon.“Ever since she was admitted here, we were discussing whether she should stay in the hostel or rent a room near her college… She joined college only 12 days ago,” her father, Ravindra Singh said. “She used to come to college from home with her friend every day. It took about an hour. Many times, she would catch a bus and if the bus was not available, she would take a rickshaw. I had no idea that such an incident could happen to my daughter,” her father added.Narrating a few minutes after the incident on 27th October, Ankit said that she was taken to the hospital immediately by her friend and the auto-rickshaw driver. “When we reached there, we found her in a critical condition. She had suffered severe head injuries. We shifted her to this hospital… I was in the village when I got a call from the college that my sister had met with an accident. My question is why are police not able to control such crimes,” he pondered. Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

In the analysis, there are certain aspects which are doubtful regarding the transfer of ₹ 338 crore transfer is established. We have rejected the bail,” said Justice Khanna.Sisodia, who is facing money laundering and corruption charges over alleged irregularities in the framing and implementation of a now-scrapped Delhi liquor policy, has been in custody since February of this year and is being investigated by both the Central Bureau of Investigation and the Enforcement Directorate.Notably, on October 19, a Delhi Court extended the judicial custody of Manish Sisodia until November 22.The liquor policy for 2021-22 was put into effect by the Delhi administration on 17th November 2021, however, it was cancelled at the end of September 2022 due to accusations of corruption. The investigating authorities assert that under the new plan of action, for financial reasons. According to the agencies, the new regulation led to monopolisation and gave economic advantages to people who weren’t eligible for liquor licenses.On the other hand, Manish Sisodia and the Delhi administration have denied any wrongdoing and claimed that the new policy would have increased the state’s excise revenue.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

102,"30 October, 2023 ","Meet Dilly Hussain: Deputy Editor of ‘5 Pillars’, portal which also fanned Leicester violence, now threatens Israelis, had called for turning India ‘Islamic’"," The X (formely Twitter) account of Dilly Hussain has now been withheld in India.On Monday (30th October), the Deputy Editor of the Islamic propaganda website ‘5 Pillars’ called for the targeted harassment and persecution of Israelis in Muslim-majority countries.Dilly Hussain, a British-born Islamist from Bangladesh, works as the Deputy Editor of ‘5 Pillars.’ In a tweet on Monday, he announced, “This is the kind of welcome all Israelis should be receiving at the airports of Muslim-majority countries.”His tweet came hours after a mob of frenzied Islamists ambushed the Dagestan airport in Russia, chanted anti-Semitic slogans and prevented Israeli passengers from deboarding at the airport. Encouraged by the actions of his fellow co-religionists, Hussain called for the setting up of a similar blockade against Israelis in Muslim-dominated nations. Earlier in July this year, he had tried to rationalise acts of terror by Islamists as ‘fighting oppression and resisting occupation.’He was also seen glorifying terrorism by claiming it to be ‘defensive jihad’ against ‘oppressors and occupiers.’Besides his brazen display of anti-Semitism, the Deputy Editor of ‘5 Pillars’ has a history of peddling anti-India and anti-Hindu propaganda. In a tweet on India’s Independence Day, he hoped that the Hindu-majority country would soon fall prey to Islamic rule.“On Indian Independence Day, I pray that Allah (swt): Liberates Indian-occupied Kashmir; Eases the suffering of Muslims and other oppressed minorities; For India to return to Islamic rule. Ameen” he brazened out.Dilly Hussain was seen using dehumanising language against the Hindu community and praying to Allah for the doom of ‘Mushrikeen’ (idolators). “The mushrikeen of India are unsurprisingly backing France over their attacks against the Prophet (saw),” he wrote in a tweet, criticising the response of India’s Hindus against the beheading of Samuel Paty by an Islamic terrorist.The Deputy Editor of ‘5 Pillars’ had tried to mobilise support from Pakistanis and Bangladeshi Muslims over the Karnataka Hijab controversy.This was despite the fact that the Karnataka High Court upheld that the Hijab is not an integral part of Islam and that uniform is a reasonable restriction on ‘Right to Religion.’The Islamic propaganda site ‘5 Pillars’ interviewed ‘sheroes’ of Barkha Dutt, namely, Ladeeda Farzana and Aysha Renna in December 2019 to spread canards about India.Ladeeda, in one of her posts, had openly called for ‘Jihad’ and had said that people should “learn about our ‘Jihad’”. In another post of hers from April 2018, she was found disrespecting the country by showing ‘middle fingers’ to India. Similarly, Aysha Renna, the face of anti-CAA riots at Jamia, had called India ‘fascist’ for hanging the terrorist Yakub Memon for his involvement in the Mumbai Blasts that killed hundreds of people.Dilly Hussain was also seen fearmongering about the future of India after Narendra Modi was re-elected as the Prime Minister of India in May 2019.The Deputy Editor of ‘5 Pillars’ was seen challenging the sovereignty of India and claiming that the erstwhile State of Jammu and Kashmir did not belong to it.“In the same way, a handspan of Palestine doesn’t belong to the Zionist entity of Israel, not a handspan of Kashmir belongs to India,” he had tweeted.The Islamic Propaganda site ‘5 Pillars’, run by Dilly Hussain had tried to pin the blame on the Hindus for the Leicester violence. The Henry Jackson Society (HJS), founded in 2005, released a 39-page report [pdf] on November 3 and concluded that the false allegations about the Hindu community in Leicester exposed them to hate, vandalism and assault.“Contrary to press reports at the time, the investigations did not find Hindutva extremist organisations operating in Leicester, but instead discovered a micro-community cohesion issue falsely presented as an issue of organised Hindutva extremism and terrorism,” the summary of the report read.Majid Freeman instigated violence in the city of Leicester where Muslim mobs went on a rampage against the Hindu community following the Asia Cup India-Pakistan cricket match on August 28, 2022.Majid Freeman is a local Leicester Muslim “activist” who is known to harbour problematic and extremist Islamic views. It was reported that Freeman played a key role in spreading fake information and instigating the Muslim mob to launch an attack on Hindu homes and religious places. Later in September that year, he repeated his lie claiming that a Muslim boy had been targeted and attacked by Muslims in the city. However, the Leicester police had responded to Majid saying that such an incident had not happened.Leicester City Mayor Sir Peter Soulsby met Islamist Majid Freeman, who was at the helm of the Leicester disinformation campaign and helped him set the narrative in favour of the perpetrators. The meeting was covered by ‘5 Pillars’, which introduced him as a ‘Muslim activist.’The Islamic propaganda site also repeated the lie about the supposed involvement of RSS in the Leciester violence.The Islamic propaganda site was also seen peddling make-believe stories to portray Islamists as the victims and the Hindu community as the perpetrators.Given his innate hatred against Hindus and India, it comes as no surprise that Dilly Hussain has now called for the targeted harassment of the Jewish community and Israelis in Muslim-majority countries.
